Details about the meeting and webcast are available on the Agilent Investor Relations website. And now, let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael McMullen Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter for the Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight three key results. First, revenue growth was up over 8% on a core basis. Second, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 19.4% an increase of 110 basis points from a year ago. Finally, EPS of $0.44 was up 16% over last year.  Before moving on to a view of our Q2 results, I do want to address our year-over-year quarterly comparisons which reflect the unusual event from last year of 8% core growth that we're announcing today about 1.5 percentage points is due to our shift of our revenue last year from Q2 '15 into Q3 '15. In the second quarter year ago, we experienced $50million of shipment delays due to startup challenges with our new U.S. logistic center. In addition, our process improvement efforts over the past two quarters to convert our incoming orders more quickly to revenue have paid-off. We have reduced our order to revenue cycle times particularly in China. Consequently some shipments initially forecasted for Q3 of this year were delivered in Q2. Agilent's strong Q2 results were led by double digit core growth in pharma and food markets. We also experienced continued strength in Academia & Government, Environmental and Diagnostic and Clinical Markets. All end markets grew except Chemical & Energy. Growth was broad based across our most of our portfolios. Geographically all regions grew except Japan led by very strong growth in China. Let me highlight our Q2 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 8% led by strong demand in the pharma and food markets. About three percentage points of the 8% increase was thanks to a softer compare due to the timing issues mentioned earlier from last year's U.S. logistic centre startup. A combination of strong topline growth, expense management and growth margin improvements partially due to the NMR exit drove LSAG's operating margin to 19%, up 320 basis points from a year ago. LSAG continues to strength this portfolio in Q2 as it introduced VistaFlux software. This new software speeds up clinical research data analysis, so scientists can more quickly understand the underlying causes of diseases such as cancer. VistaFlux strengthens Agilent’s leadership decision in metabolomics. Last week we announced a new Agilent 1260, infinity-II LC at the analytical trade show. This instrument provides best-in-class lab efficiency and improves the formats of full backward compatibility. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continued to deliver consistently strong revenue results. Core revenue growth in Q2 was 10% led by strength in contract services, LC columns and lab supplies. Expansion and penetration in Asia continued to be the strong contributors to our growth. Operating margin was flat versus year ago at 21.5%.CrossLab represents a strategic transformation of our services and consumables business. I’m pleased to report that Agilent was recognized with 2016 Reviewers Choice award for customer service. This award is from Select Science, an independent expert led scientific review. This is the second year in a row, that scientists in North America have judged Agilent's customer service to be the best in the Laboratory products industry. Finally the Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 5% core growth in Q2 against a difficult compare. The pathology business continues on its steady trajectory back to market growth rates., highlighted by the strong demand for our new PD-L1companion and complimentary diagnostic tests. Genomics showed strong market performance led by our SureSelect Target Enrichment and our Array CGH offerings. DGG's operating margin was flat versus year ago at 15%. In Q2 Agilent announced an $80million investment in Lasergen, an emerging biotechnology company with innovative next-gen sequencing technology. Our two companies will collaborate on building an NGS workflow for clinical applications. In Q2, Agilent also announced the commercial availability has expanded to the EU for a new PD-L1diagnostic test for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This diagnostic was developed through a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of OPDIVO.  Now, I’ll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets saw a continuation of our first quarter performance with strength across all end markets. Pharma grew 14% fueled by technology research deals, new product uptick, and sustained growth in the aftermarket. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than mid to high double digit growth in pharma. Academia & Government grew 7% driven by strong demand in China and an uptick in the U.S. Clinical diagnostics also grew 7% with strength in genomics led by target enrichment in Array CGH. Applied end market performance was mixed. Flu was up 25% with strong sales in China and the Americas. China also drove 6% worldwide growth in environmental forensics. Chemical energy declined 3%, reflecting continued macroeconomic concerns and the effects of lower oil prices. Now, I’d turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiative. Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement delivered by the new Agilent team. This will resolve our ability to outgrow the market while driving operational efficiency improvements. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company, making us more nimble and lowering our cost. Our execution of companywide streamline of organizations, processes, and systems continues to be on track to deliver incremental saving in 2017. For example, in Q3, we will take a major step forward in simplifying the company's system infrastructure with all of our financial systems now on SAP. On the capital deployment front, we paid $37 million in dividends, repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock and invested 80 million to enable our NGS workflow strategy. Finally, our one Agilent initiative driving was well-received cultural transformation to improve cost company collaboration and delivering of results. At last year's Analyst and Investor Day described a shareholder value creation model for Agilent to be driven by outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins and a balanced capital allocation policy. I'd like to take a minute to position the Q2 results in the context of our longer term goals. After delivering our highest annual core revenue growth in 2011 of 6.4% in 2015, we’ve now had two strong quarters to start 2016 including this quarter's 8% core revenue growth. Since the new Agilent leadership team has put in place, the team has delivered year-over-year operating margin improvements every quarter. We’ve completed the offset the initial $40 million into synergies from the Company's split. In fiscal 2015, we returned $400 million to shareholders and $370 million year-to-date in 2016 through cash dividends and share repurchase. From 2015 onto now, we’ve also invested our 400 million in new business via M&A and equity investments. Didier will share more specifics later while we are raising our full year 2016 outlook for core growth, operating margin, EPS, and cash flow. Let me now talk about our second half '16 forecast in light of what we’ve already achieved in 2016 and what we plan to deliver in 2017. We look at today's overall market environment while we face increasingly tough competitors, we expect strength and pharma are continuing the second half of 2016 and into 2017. China is also expected to remain strong in second half of 2016 and 2017. Taking a closer look at the chemical and energy market, we’ve been experiencing a more prolong and steeper slowdown than initially anticipated. We are now forecasting overall low single digit market declines for the year versus our initial flat guidance assumptions. The oil exploration segment of this market has been down significantly for some time with a recent well reported spill over into the refining segment. There are initial indications however of a bottoming with increased deal activity in the large chemical segment of the market.  We have projected an improved chemical and energy market environment in 2017. We are assuming we will continue to face headwinds in this market for the remainder of 2016. We are currently modeling 2017 with an above market core revenue growth of 4.5%. This is in line with our projected full year 2016 core growth rates, but higher than our expected core growth rate in the second half of 2016. There are two reasons for this increase. First, we expect to have a very strong new product introduction in the second half of FY '16 which will drive revenue growth in FY 17. Second, on the end market front, we expect chemical energy to have bottomed out by year end, accompanied by continuing solid conditions and all of our other end markets and in China. Overall, we remain on track with your 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margins to 22%. Looking inside the company, I can share with you today that the one Agilent team is working well together and is driven to win in the marketplace. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst and Investor Day where I will share our progress versus our commitments. How we will sustain our improved performance and the longer term outlook for the company. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016. Didier? Didier Hirsch Thank you Mike and hello everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered a strong performance this quarter again. 8% core revenue growth, 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and $256 million in operating cash flow. After adjusting for last year’s $15 million slippage in revenue from Q2 to Q3 as we launched our new U.S. logistic center, our core revenue growth of 6.5% remained well above market. During the quarter, we bought back $94 million of stock and paid $37 million in dividends. Finally, on May 3, we successfully moved all finance applications from Oracle to SAP which is our main ERP. This will result in significant simplifications of our finance and IT operations. I’ll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.47. At mid-point, revenue will grow 1.3% on a core basis, or close to 3% adjusting for last year’s $15 million impact from the U.S. logistics center. And turning to share repurchase, we expect to buy back $93 million this Q3. Now, to the guidance of fiscal year 2016. We are raising the mid-point of our revenue guidance by $60 million including $50 million due to currencies. As a result, we are increasing our core revenue growth guidance at mid-point from 4.25% to 4.50%. We are also raising the mid-point of our EPS guidance by $0.06 including $0.03 coming from currency and $0.03 from operational performance. And one important note. After further review, we and our auditors have concluded to account for the Lasergen investment using the cost method account. This means that we will not book our share Lasergen losses as previously communicated. Finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance from $650 million to $740 million and there is no change to our CapEx guidance of $140 million. With that, I’ll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez Thank you, Didier. And Sabrina, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A. <p id="question-answer-session" class="p p4">Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Dan Leonard Thank you. Two questions. First off, can you elaborate on the business trends you're seeing in Europe? And then secondly on the pharma end market, can you talk about what gives you confidence in the fiscal '17 outlook that you have yet another strong year in pharma, following two years then of tough comps in capital markets, which have been more or less shut? Thank you.  Michael McMullen Thanks Dan. I think I’m actually going to pass that over to Patrick who is just back from a trip to Europe and maybe he can provide some insight on what’s going on in Europe and then also if he can pick up the question on pharma as well. Patrick Kaltenbach Sure. I’m happy to do so. Let me start first giving you some insights on Europe. We have seen actually some decent growth in Central Europe, we have seen some weaknesses on what we call the idea was states Eastern Europe and that's mainly driven by the Chemical & Energy market or the Energy market of that site. In Central Europe there is deadly strengths in Germany and other states around that. We still see some issues on academia and government side is rather flat, but pharma for example is also very strong in Europe. For your pharma question, overall we are confident that we will continue to see pretty high growth in pharma. For the remainder of this year we target low double digit growth for pharma and looking into 2017 we think the pharma market will be continue to be strong for us driven by two vectors. We see a continue demand in the replacement business and as you probably know we just launched at the Analytica conference we launched our new 1216-20L series as an example together with the InfinityLab consumables and service and we think that will drive – continue to drive a lot of good replacement for us in pharma. And then we see also continue demand in the biopharma space that are looking for new solutions helping with these more complex molecules in terms of analysis and we have a very comprehensive offering for a space as well. Dan Leonard Thank Patrick. Great, thank you.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open. Jonathan Groberg Congratulations on another great quarter, Mike. Can you maybe elaborate a little on - I think you said core guidance, and if I'm looking at your presentation, core revenue growth guidance in the third quarter is pretty precise at 1.3%. I think I just heard that you still expect pharma to grow low double digits. Could you give a little insight as to what you're seeing in the third quarter? Mike McMullen Yes, what we looked at was what's our growth rate that we've had over the first half of this year and as we look into Q3 and Q4. And what I'd point to is a couple of things, Jonathan first of all tough compares and this is inclusive of a few one-time moves between quarters which actually were driven by improvements overall operation, so as Didier mentioned we had this $50 million shift in Q2 of last year into Q3 - which when we had our start up issues of the new logistics center. So we adjust for that to catch-up about 3% growth. The other thing we saw happen in Q2 was we’ve been working really hard to improve the overall cycle time from the time a customer places order to actually install and we can recognize a revenue. In Q2 we actually see their expectations and we got there a lot faster we had thought. And what that meant was, we had a significant amount of revenue probably $20 million to $25 million that came from Q3 into Q2 where initially had forecasted into the third quarter. On all of you kind of take into account those things you've got put in more of a consistent kind of a growth scenario between Q2 and Q3. I would tell you though the chemical and energy is still looking for a bottom and that's why we have that outlook for the year which basically this down it will stay down for the rest of the year. There are some signs that it could be getting better. But we have not convinced yet we've seen the bottom chemical and energy. So I think the combination of those tough compares as well as our outlook on chemical and energy is what's driving the overall guidance for the second half.  Jonathan Groberg Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess just one more. Are there any - sometimes when we see shifts onto one platform, like Oracle to SAP, is there anything at all, any wiggle room you've left there, in terms of hiccups in the quarter, or maybe just --? Mike McMullen What we thought to do you're exactly right Jonathan. So the wiggle room we left was we made sure we went live first month of the quarter. And Didier is in the conference room here smiling and Didier if you want to add any additional color on how it's going so far. Didier Hirsch Yes, it's going very well the migrations and the start up of the operation there was zero disruption. Obviously we expect to have to deal with some stabilization activities throughout the quarter we'll do too close before we do the quarterly close. So everything we couldn’t be happier about how it went and you're correct, it is a very complex and one that we're pretty used to, we’ve done a few of those in the past, but still it remains a very complex interview and we are really happy how smoothly it went. Mike McMullen And Jonathan as I pointed out in my script, this is one of the Agile Agilent initiatives which you'll start to see pay offs in our cost structure as we move into 2017. Jonathan Groberg Great, thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tycho Peterson Just following up on that last point on the SAP margins, can you maybe - on the margin impact. Can you maybe quantify how much that could play on margins for this year? Mike McMullen For 2016 I think it would be very limited at best Tycho, because we’ll be running some duplicate backup systems and then the other aspects of our external spends, later on come out to 2017. So I really position that in - as you think about this more of the 2017 impact, but prove point why we think we're going to be able to improve our margins again in 2017. Tycho Peterson And then academic, 7%, can you maybe just talk as to whether you're seeing an acceleration there? What you saw this quarter? Didier Hirsch Yes, what we saw in the last quarter is really strong performance in China and some increased signs of life in the U.S. side of things, I think and that's will be pointing to an uptick. None a lot of significant moves on the European side is mainly a China story, and I think there'll be upside to it to become from the U.S. how we're thinking about it. Tycho Peterson Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of pharma, obviously that's been a nice driver. Can you maybe talk about where you think we are in the LCMS upgrade cycle, and how much your growth going forward is going to be contingent on R&D budget expanding versus the upgrade cycle? Mike McMullen Yes sure Tycho great question, I know Patrick now look at this pretty closely and what’s the update of you on that. Patrick Kaltenbach Yes, so I think the two cycles we’re looking at, the first sight we went through was the upgrade cycle from sell HPLC to UHPLC which is still ongoing but a considerable part of that probably has been done. But when you look at the installed base of instrumentation it still deals with core LC and this is where we are targeting with the Infinity II Series right now. There's still a lot of foot placement pending out there. Just as reminder, we had probably about 150,000 systems out there based on the 1100, 1200 platform which overtime will be up for replacement and we have positioned extremely well in the pharma platforms because it's 100% bankruptcy compatible and we’re also able to for example to emulate some of our competitor systems on our platforms of a technology we called ISET intelligence system emulation technology. And that actually compels very nicely based on our customers and gives us a unique advantage in the market.   A – Mike McMullen So I think we see both those having legs in 2017. A – Patrick Kaltenbach Absolutely. I think it goes on into 2017 combined again with the drive we see coming out of biopharma. Q – Tycho Peterson Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Q – Jack Meehan Hi thanks. Good afternoon guys. I just wanted to start, the better - at least relative to what I was looking for, looked like you had better gross margins in the LSAG segment, now two quarters in a row. Can you just talk about what some of the notable changes there are? Is there anything with product mix that's driven the improvement, or do you think this is the new norm to look for? Mike McMullen Let me make some initial comments and then Didier or Patrick you can add – build to it. So in terms of product mix, part of what you're seeing is the fact that we are winding down through our P&L the impact of the NMR business, and I think you can see the benefit of that exit decision on the P&L because it really has been contributing to the - improved the gross margins. That's not the whole story. The other story is obviously the strong demand for the products and the volume benefits we're getting, as well as the focus on taking cost out of our material cost side of our business as well as we talk a lot about the logistics last year, we can also talk about logistics this year, which is we're doing a much better job in terms of overall logistics operations that's blowing through on the P&L as well. So Didier I'm not sure if I missed anything else. A – Didier Hirsch No, you covered it all. Thank you. Jack Meehan Great. And then just one more for the adoption of the companion diagnostics, now a few quarters into the launch. Are you in a position, could you maybe help us size what that business is today, or just in the market, what you think you hold in terms of market share? Thanks. Mike McMullen Why don’t you take that Jacob? Jacob Thaysen Yes, thanks for that question and we are definitely pleased with the pick off the PD-L1 and this continues during the last basically now three quarters. The market is still very early. We still really only in U.S. we’ve had a press releases here lately also that we are entering into Europe but we are just scratching the surface in Europe. And furthermore it’s still addressing the second line treatment and if that also goes to the first line treatment the market will become significantly larger. At this point of time it’s still small revenue in the biggest scheme of things but I do believe that the PD-L1 has an opportunity to be as big as the other two markets. However, I will also remind you that of at least four probably five different potential blocks and companion diagnostic outset has to share that market. So, still early days but a great opportunity. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brandon Couillard Thanks. Mike or Didier, could you give us the China growth rate, the percentage change in the quarter, and if you could speak to demand in the food area outside of China and Asia, that would be helpful? Didier Hirsch Yes. In the China our resolve for Q2 what we've been pointing to is a strong double digit growth. It was a very, very strong quarter for us in China, I would remind you that part of the strong growth was not only the strength of the market but also the operational efficiency improvement I talked about, where we really shortened the improved cycle time from orders to install that was really dramatic in China. So, the overall business is quite strong here, you should not expect a strong double digit growth every quarter though for Q3, Q4 quarter. But, overall China is - Mr. McMullen completed the story here. When we came into this year, we thought that the overall performance for Agilent in China might be high single digits but now look a low double digit growth in China for the full year.  Brandon Couillard Thanks. One more for Didier. I notice you bumped the operating cash flow guidance of about $90 million. How much of an impact does the - I noticed the tax refund benefit. If you could quantify that, and just help us bridge the delta between prior versus new? Didier Hirsch The over-all tax outlays forecast for this year, were I think about $10 million less than what we had anticipated in our initial guidance, $10million or $15million. And the rest is really operational performance, improvements, working capital, management, FX and then just our operating profits. Brandon Couillard Super. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Ross Muken Good afternoon, guys. Mike, since taking over it's obviously been a pretty hectic journey, and your messaging from the beginning has been pretty consistent around growth in margins and returns. Obviously, the last few quarters you started develop a cadence, last quarter results were good, but we had the challenges on FX. Do you feel like this is the first quarter where you feel like you got to deliver the full bag, where you were able to drop through the top line outperformance, which is clearly better than market, you drove the margins, you're buying stock, the returns are up, the cash flow's good, that you were finally able to show the market that the business model's working, and that feeds, I guess, into your confidence also, I would assume, on 2017? Michael McMullen Yes. I couldn’t said have better of myself. Thanks Ross for the question, I think that we’ve been working really hard over last four, five quarters with our new leadership team and as you look at everything came together this quarter, we had strong growth, and we had improvement in our operating margin that pointed out of 2015. But all of the factors really came together nicely in the second quarter, and I was particularly pleased on the more operational activities that we are working on inside the company. And that may not always be so apparent initially on the outside world, but you're started to see the results. The fact we are doing, it’s just a logistic challenge, here I have to talk about near year compares but expects – actually is now contributing to improved results. Yes, we had a talk about the shortened cycle time for orders to revenue and burdensome revenues of what we’ve initially planned for the third quarter but we made this operational improvement the cycle times are shorter and this is now the new normal. So, I guess that was the closing comments, yes with a new normal for the company we have a lot of confidence about 2017. Perhaps, it’s been a little bit of thunder for the Analyst meeting next week but still hope everyone attends, but when you start have these prove points of quarter in and quarter out. I think it starts to show you the team is delivering and I think the results are now starting to be appreciated and believed. Ross Muken Great. And maybe quickly just on Seahorse, can you just give us an update on how that business is performing relative to your expectations, and how it's plugged in, and where you're seeing maybe the early fruits and some cross-synergy with the existing business? Mike McMullen Yes, we just in fact very timely question Ross, we just had our 180 day review this morning and Patrick you want to go ahead and share a couple highlights from that session. Patrick Kaltenbach Sure absolutely, what I really would like to highlight is how seamlessly the integration of Seahorse went, so we are now at now six months in the integration and we will say the targeting full integration by June which means that you have implemented all of the systems which is a pretty fast pace.  At the same time we are seeing the positioning of Seahorse regional portfolio really works out, we see nice deals and combined sales of LCMS and Seahorse and areas like disease research and disease discovery that is actually exactly where we thought it's complementing a lot of strength in metabolomics with the life style metabolism which Seahorse brings today. And this is a very nice story that wasn't really expected well before our customers. Again we on a integration side, we are very pleased with where we stand and we are looking forward to a very successful second half. Mike McMullen Yes, Ross I’d add two things. The comment I made to the team this morning this is the fastest I've seen is doing integration. These things usually plod along for many quarters in some cases for years this one is moving along really, really fast. And we're getting some wins the fact we want an LCMS deal because Seahorse , so it’s the complementary nature the portfolio is starting to work.  Ross Muken Excellent thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. Paul Knight Mike, the move you made to creates CrossLab seems to be gaining traction. Can you give us a little background on CrossLab, in terms of who do you think is taking -- it's taking share from somebody at that growth rate. Could you give us more color on CrossLab? Mike McMullen Yes, so as you mentioned that was a major strategic move where when we some the company we established as CrossLab group. We had this division about how we could really attack and go after the enterprise wide services and consumers' opportunity. And as you see marketing team have really been delivering and we know that customers are responding to the value proposition that Agilent offers both in terms of our service capability is due and that's why I mentioned in my script about the external recognition we recently received.  But they also appreciate the fact we’re able to give them insights in terms of actually helping them improve the business operation and we're seeing a real strong demand for this in the pharma and growing interest in other parts that flag markets. So we know that we're growing faster than some of our competitors in this space. We also know that there's only a few companies really trying to go after this type of business, I believe this is where the market is already going to, and I think you want to be a player here. And I'll leave it to you guys to figure out who's the losing share. But I think, I can tell you as we're growing close to double digit in the space, so that been attractive move for us.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.  Tim Evans Thanks, congratulations on a good quarter. I just wanted to make sure I understand the variance in the quarter relative to what you were expecting. I believe you had called last quarter for 4% core growth, and we saw 8% this quarter. I hear you, that it sounds like about half of that variance, about 200 basis points, was from the better book backlog to revenue conversion this quarter. And I know you also called out the compare relative to last year. But that compare should have already been known. So I just want to understand what's the other 200 basis points, that really surprised you in the quarter? Mike McMullen Sure Tim, again thanks for your comment and I can give you a few dollar numbers of the revenue impact the way we look at it in. And you can do them perhaps the math on the impact on the on the growth rates, but what we saw a relative to our initial expectations for the quarter were really – well first let's start with the market right, so the overall market demand came in as we predicted, we saw good growth across entire portfolio led by pharma improve markets in China as you heard earlier.  But I'd ask you to look at two things, one is this higher conversion of water to revenue than forecast so base what we’ve done as we reduce the cycle time and by our estimates it happens lot faster than we had thought, which I think is good news from the standpoint of operational efficiency did create some forecasting challenges, but probably $20 million to $25 million came from Q3 into Q2 the other thing I think you should take a look at is the FX assumptions so around $9 million or so Didier think that’s the number. Didier Hirsch Yes, fine. Mike McMullen FX added about another $9 million so between the cycle time improvements the FX assumptions and is the fact of the market continues to get we're getting our fair share of markets where they're growing I think those companies those three facts I think will help you bridge the difference between our guided growth and what actually occurred. Tim Evans Okay. Just a real quick similar question on the margin side. Obviously a little bit of the margin in the quarter was the drop-through, but it looks like you probably did better than you were expecting on an absolute dollar basis on the SG&A, as well. Can you help me understand maybe what is going a little faster there than you anticipated? Mike McMullen Yes, I think on the SG&A front I mean we got a couple of our programs inside in the agile are little bit ahead of plan. But Didier if there's anything else -  Didier Hirsch Most of the impact was volume driven and obviously the FX, but there was – versus the usual guidance. Mike McMullen I will tell you the field structure that we put in place last year. You know it's really stable down I think it's delivering helping us on the growth side and also on the SG&A front as more efficient g to market channel. Tim Evans Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro Good afternoon, thank you. I had a question on margins, as well. On the gross margin side, I was curious if we should expect maybe another wave of improvement, now that you have the ERP integration done. And on the op margin side, curious how satisfied you are with the sales force realignment, and whether or not there's still more synergies to be had there as well? Mike McMullen Yes, a couple of comments here then I’ll hand [ph] that over to Didier in a case like to add a few things here. But in terms of the sales force integration and go to market we couldn't be happier I mean that was a major move made last year where we basically went from five sales force into sales forces one focused on the analytical laboratory marketplace and other one focused on the regulated diagnostic marketplace. As the time I remember sharing with you, hey we're making a big change here and it could affect the top line in the short one that didn't happen. And in fact I submit that as we go out into 2016 and 2017 we're now putting more resources of specialization academia in biopharma, so I think you can see the changes paying off in terms of long term growth. So we're really happy with both the fact that we've got it all behind us and settle down and think it started to pay off on the initial benefits of in vision when we created that structure.  Relative to gross margin ERP I just keep in mind that what we've been talking about is a financial systems which really go into the SG&A line so it really won't affect the gross margin. That being said we do think we can do more on gross margins as we move forward in 2016 and 2017. I'll talk a little bit more about in detail next week in New York but as you may know our initial 400 basis points improvement when I came on board we said half a come through OpEx and other operational costs and then others through grow in the growth piece of the a lot of the driven by our ability to capture the gross margin improvements on increase volume. So we think we still have room to improve our material cost. And we think that we've got room to continue to bring down our logistics cost.  Isaac Ro That's very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up, just to clarify on two topics, one on biopharma, and the other one on the comments you made around China. On biopharma, could you just compare the growth rates you're seeing in the QA/QC setting versus R&D, and then in China, just curious, how much of your improved outlook there is based on the visibility you have with government funding versus end markets that are more on the private industry side? Thank you. Mike McMullen I think that on the question – we're not seeing a real significant differences in growth rates across the segment you described in pharma, I do think if you go out a couple years down the road I think we'd expect the growth rate in the biopharma be higher than a small molecule with us not that long at all the case right now and you’ve heard earlier from Patrick we expect that to continue through 2017. We're getting more clarity about what's going on in China, I think there was a lot of concerns at one point time on the private sector side of the business, but obviously as you know I think the government drives the market there to a large extent and we're getting more clarity on what's happening in funding so that's why we have increased confidence in our outlook for our business in China.  Isaac Ro Got it. Thanks Mike, see you next week.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Derik De Bruin Hi good afternoon. Just wanted to clarify. Did I hear you correctly, that you said your initial flash for core growth guidance for FY17 was 4.5% at the midpoint? Mike McMullen Yes.  Derik De Bruin Okay. And so can you like flank that in terms of what you're thinking for the chemical and energy market there? I mean, just what you're expecting in terms of rebound? Could you help us frame that comment a little bit more, in terms of some of the puts and takes. Mike McMullen Sure I'd be happy to because sometimes you use colorful language it doesn't really give you the insight you need, so let me try to clarify here. So what we said was in this year we thought our performance would be flat for the entire year. Well in fact it's going to be down, we probably think in the range 2.5%, 3% for the entire year. And that is the change from our assumptions come in this year and that was the assumption be made at the time our initial guidance which makes our revenue results even much more we're really pleased with the results given the fact that the chemical energy market is not develop the way we initially had and thought.  That being said in 2017 we actually will be improved which means it won't be redo it won't be declining and in fact will probably be flat or maybe low single digits and why do we believe that, if you look at how our business breaks down in that segment we often talk about the oil side, but 50% of our business historically has been in the exploration of another 35% has been in the refining the other half which is by far the biggest, I mean biggest individual segment is the chemical side and they're benefiting by lower feedstock costs they've got pent up investment demands and we're starting to see increased deal activity. So in fact Patrick and I were talking about this morning the kind reminds me of a pharma a few years ago, basically it’s going to have years of shrinking performance in this marketplace. A lot of pent up demand so long story short our growth assumption would actually assumes the low single digit chemical energy growth for the year. Again we still believe we're a surge from the bottom, so it's in still early in the year of 2016 but that's our basic assumption for 207 which is an improved environment, not dramatic, but improved from what we've seen over the last 24 months.   Derik De Bruin Just as a quick follow-up on the chemicals comment. You're not worried that some of the activity between Dow and DuPont, and looks like there may be Monsanto and some of these other companies that are dancing around, are you worried that could stymie investment, if you're using the pharma analogy of combinations of those companies, is there some potential headwinds from the chemicals market? Mike McMullen Yes, that’s a great question and we looked at this pretty closely when announcement was first made and although Dow and DuPont are very important customers to us that particular deal activity really is immaterial to the total Company’s performance. And then we don't necessary it is the sign of an acceleration M&A and a consolidation is going on in the space. So of course there would be some pause if we would see more of that, but we're not overly concerned about that and I guess the beauty of this business has been just the broad based nature of our customer base or not overly dependent on the one single customer. Derik De Bruin Thank you very much. I’ll be back in the queue.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Q – Daniel Arias Good afternoon, thanks. Mike, can you touch on Japan and things that you saw during the quarter in terms of trends, and maybe what you're looking for at this point on the year? Mike McMullen Yes. So Dan, there's a question in and if you know a little bit my history it's been to five years in Japan, so I always been a big support of Japan in terms of a long term view of the market. And I'd ask to take a long term view of the market in Japan, so that was the only market that actually went down for us in the second quarter and we are expecting continued some do performance in Japan, so we're not expecting much in terms of improvement in the overall market environment in Japan.  We do think that it could be a market which often will respond to new technologies and innovative new products. So we do hope that we do hold out hope that we could take some share from our new intros coming out in the second part of this year of an overall market perspective, we're expecting remain some dude in our internal forecasts are not are not based on any type of material improvement on our performance in Japan. Daniel Arias Okay. Thanks for that color. And you teased some new product introductions in the back half, that should be meaningful to growth. I'm sure you don't want to give away any secrets. Could you sort of help us with what part of the business you're anticipating seeing the boost in 2017? Mike McMullen Yes, so thanks for the caveat on your question. So what we can point to it great confidence and clarity is the recent introduction we made in analytic. But I would say to you, you will see broad based introduction the cross the entire portfolio and who are growth essential to our business plan as you know I came in last year, we spent a lot of time, we were realizing in our R&D structure and also reallocating where we put money and I think we’re going to start to see some of that starting to pay off as we go into a later part of 2016. So we did want to put a teaser out there and but also just make sure you have confidence in terms what’s behind our view of improved Agilent performance in 2017 second half of this year, but I think you can expect to see is talking about acting to the cross all three business groups. Daniel Arias Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Shankle of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.  Doug Shankle Hi good afternoon. Mike, I want to go back to some of the comments you made, on efforts to tighten cycle times from order to revenue, which seemed to be yielding benefits sooner than expected, particularly in China. Can you provide a bit more background on this effort, and why it was most impactful in China?  And then maybe talk about similar efforts under way in other geographies? And relatedly, you positioned these, in answering some questions, as if they were temporary. At least it seems like your guidance doesn't treat these as sustainable improvements, yet everything else you said suggests that these are truly sustainable improvements. So I was just hoping you could help us understand that a little bit better. Mike McMullen Yes, sure Doug, I really appreciate the question. And maybe may start with the last part of your question which is the takeaway here we do believe this is a sustainable improvement, so in my mind the language I use this is the new normal in terms of ability to convert orders to revenue. And so I would characterize this is new normal how we're going operate so how do we get here and why did they look so significantly different in China, so first of all starts with looking at the entire process from an end to end customer perspective from the time of order placement of shipment into custom installation occurs.  And as you know when I restructure the company I was really trying to break down the silos and we had a very siloed or an approach to this end to end process from a customer respective, in the company we looked at each slice of the process, but nobody looking at the collective process and then you start doing that and you start seeing where the issues are the opportunities are so we found ways to improve our order linearity, we’ve improved the quality of booked orders and this really gets to your question about China often you're dealing with letters or credit issues and then other trade issues that in the past have delayed our ability to actually book them as clean orders and turn them into revenue. We call the delivery box, we've been working on making sure we had material availability. I think we hit one of our best quarters ever in terms of having material ready for all our shipments so we improve our ability to get in orders in a linear fashion. Make sure those orders are clean and not have lot of rework. And then we have improved our delivery performance and then spent a lot of time improving our efforts between shipment installation which sometimes can go on for several weeks. So I think it all starts with this looking at the whole process from an end to end perspective and the result has been a significant improvement in a cycle in orders turned into revenue more quickly than in the past. I do think this represents our new way of operating and again as I mentioned in my remarks it did create some, it did have implications of how we guide the company for the second and third quarter but I think we’re delighted to be able to actually have ongoing strong operational efficient improvement in place so, that we know how to predict revenue even better in the future. Doug Shankle Okay. That's really helpful, Mike. But just to be really clear, recognizing these are well-learned sustainable improvements, it's not apparent that this is fully - these improvements, the sustainability is fully reflected in guidance? If that's the case, is that just because you want to see this play out for a couple of quarters before you start baking it in? Didier Hirsch I think the confusion might be that what we have stated is that this quarter in Q2 we got $20 million to $25 million of revenue that we had anticipated to be recognized in Q3 as a we were bringing all those program to fruition. We had earlier results which is great from where we are now, the order to revenue cycle time is sustainable but we will not see further improvement that will bring Q4 revenue into Q3 or what already is. So the 022 to 25 that’s the one time we’ve got to the level we wanted to be at and from now on it’s just business as usual without any fundamental change in the order to revenue cycle time.   Doug Shankle All right. Thanks for that, Didier. Just one last one for you. On the change in Lasergen accounting, was there any dilution in the quarter, and based on the accounting change, should we no longer expect this to be a $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive deal for the year? Didier Hirsch Yes, correct, you are correct. So, there was no dilution in Q2 and it will not be in a dilution in for the rest of 2016 or 2017 until we exercise our call option and then we will just fully consolidate if we do that obviously - fully consolidate the Lasergen revenue. So that’s a change that, there was a lot of I mean discussions with the auditors, they surprise us a little bit by going to national to get especially some kind of challenge kind of the accounting that we had anticipated locally among the two teams and then we agreed to the recommendation and therefore no dilution to EPS coming from Lasergen in the next two years. Michael McMullen Right, and we were pleased where to get this closed off before we finish the quarter. Doug Shankle Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open. Mira Minkova Yes, hi good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe if I could focus on operating margins again for a second. Just help us, remind us, there's a lot going on there, in terms of the programs you have in place and improvements you have going on. Help us, remind us, the bridge between fiscal '16 and fiscal '17, what gets you to the 22% operating margin? A – Michael McMullen Well, as a teaser, we are going to go through this in some details. Didier Hirsch Slide on the topic next week. A – Michael McMullen But what I can share with you conceptually is that we will be continuing and completing off the integration of the Darko acquisition. We have a series of operational programs we talked to about one of those already which is the implications of the ERP and the continued focus on gross margin for its specifically material cost reductions in logistics savings. So, I think that combination of those three factors plus with the overall core growth assumption that will currently model around 4.5 get us to the 22. Mira Minkova Okay, great. And the strength in the food market, was this all China, or are you seeing strength elsewhere as well? A – Michael McMullen Actually it was both in food market, both in China and in the United States. As you may recall from Q1 announcement this business tends to be little lumpy whereas I think that performance in food market in China has been sustained but we saw a nice rebound in the U.S. in the second quarter. Mira Minkova Got you. Okay. And maybe finally, give us your view of the M&A pipeline. We've seen you do a couple of deals just recently here. Now that you have many of the operational initiatives for the new Agilent in place, should we expect that you're more active with the tuck-ins going forward? A – Michael McMullen Again this is teaser number two, which is we’re going to talk about this little bit more detail on next week but I do feel that the company’s foundation has really firmly established and as I mentioned earlier, I think we’re getting lot better in terms of speed they have to integrate but what I think you inspect to us do still remain disciplined and focus in terms of finding those opportunities that makes sense for us and I would ask you to think about as been complimentary M&A in nature, we’re going to continued to look for those. So, our balance sheet is a huge asset for our shareholders in one which you like to deploy relative to M&A but it has to be the right target. Mira Minkova Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.  Steve Beuchaw Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two clarifications on how you're thinking about the 2016, 2017 progression. The first is actually on the NIH. To what extent, if any, are you anticipating a pickup in the research channel from NIH funding, when we start to see that get disbursed in the second half of the year? And then second, this may be even a longer term question, but how do you think about the evolution of FSMA regulations in the food space in the US? Is it too soon to start getting incrementally optimistic about how they could contribute to the outlook? Thanks. Michael McMullen Yes, thanks glad to adjust both of your questions. So on the NIH front I think we talked about the uptick in the sort of our improved confidence about the spends in Academia and Government in the U.S. I think we do think that the NIH stuff will start to flow through to our business. Relative to some in our space we don’t have as a higher percentage of our business tied to the NIH but it will be a positive for us and I think again one more fact pattern which points to continue to - this market will be solid for us as we move into 2017. I think I have to agree with the comment which is - I think it’s always too soon to get overall excited about this from a U.S. spending, I’ve seen this before where legislation is announced and there is a lot of fanfare about it, but we don’t obviously a backed up by investments although we did – we're seeing some looks like some may be more friendly government allocations to this agency unlikely to seem to the EPA. So, we’re not expect anything dramatic to occur differently in the market because of this but if it would that would be clearly good news for us. Steve Beuchaw Thanks for all the perspective, Mike. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff Elliott Thanks for the question. Mike, on the margins, overall a really good quarter. Then when you look at the margins in DGG and CrossLab, basically flat year-over-year. I guess, is that what you were expecting? Anything that you could call out in the quarter? I know there's some moving pieces in that topline. Michael McMullen You want to take this one Didier. Didier Hirsch It’s a great question and the answer is yes, preciously what we had expected one of the obviously - there is from one quarter to next that could be some one time add-ons that adds a little bit of volatility. For example last year both the ACG and DGG had very favorable hedging gains which have gone away for the whole company the hedging gain last year into two was over $7 million and this Q2 was about $1.5 million. And it was mostly in the ACG and DGG and there are other onetime items including regarding the allocation of our shared services among the different businesses which explain but both businesses are on the way to contribute to the operating margin expansion and 22% that we're committing too. A – Michael McMullen Didier we also ask Mark too. We talked about this earlier this last week as well about spending operational efficiency improvements underline were booked to be flat margins that will field back hedging gains other things are actually some real operation stuff. Mark Doak Thanks Mike and Didier. As Didier said, there were several things that were factors in it last year that didn’t come into play this year but we were working on lot of things in terms of improvements, the mixes is somewhat favorable in the context of what we're selling but overall when we look our plans for the first half we are up 70 basis points in the first half over last year. So, our ability to actually due to margin improvements when you pull back and look in the first half regardless of all those things is quite positive.  Didier Hirsch And is our fastest growing business he's been thinking about more of the corporate shared services. Jeff Elliott Okay. Thanks guys. A – Mike McMullen Hope that was helpful? Q –  Yes it was, thanks. Operator Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open. Dane Leone Thanks guys. Just had a quick clarification from earlier. So you were talking about the replacement cycle in biopharma and quoted 150,000 LC systems, based on the 1100, 1200 platform. Can you clarify if that's what you think the opportunity is ahead of you, or that's the opportunity in progress? And if so, what - how far are you into that? Patrick Kaltenbach This is Patrick, let me answer these questions. First and foremost this is not biopharma, this is pharma and biopharma compliance. And when I talk about 150,000 systems out there, it's to installed base of LC systems in all markets. So it's not only in pharma and biopharma, but we think it is the biggest push is actually right now coming from pharma and biopharma. And I would still see we are in the midst of the replacement cycle, and we don't see that to be over in the next couple of quarters. So is a healthy demand and we are in negotiation is a lot of work for our core customers on upcoming replacements and how we place these systems and how we plan it out for them, so it works for them. Mike McMullen And Dane if I could add just one other comment to Patrick's response, we've been focusing a lot in today's call on pharma and biopharma, but you know keep in mind that the replacements like been very, very subdued on the implied market side in the chromatography. So we have several - we have tens of thousands of systems on that side of the house as well. Again this is why we look out in 2017 and 2018 we think that our growth rates are sustainable. Q – Dane Leone Any way you could handicap, using a baseball analogy or something like that, what inning you think you're in? A – Mike McMullen On the pharma side probably anything five or six - I think is and my point would be that I think the ball game and this getting started. Maybe in the first inning, we hope to be in the first innings soon that cycle on the implied market side. Q – Dane Leone Okay great. Thank you guys very much. Operator Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez Thank you everybody and I'd like to thank you all for joining us today on the call. If you have any questions of course please give us a call in IR and just would hope that we'll see you next week at our Analyst Day in New York City. Thanks again. Bye, bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings above the high-end of our guidance.  I will now highlight three key results. First, revenue was up over 6% on a core basis. Second, we delivered an operating margin increase of 200 basis points from a year ago to 20.2% adjusted for Keysight billings. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.46 was up 12% over last year. Our Q1 results are driven by continued strength in the pharma, clinical, and diagnostics markets with a return to growth in Academia & Government. Market demand remains strong for Liquid Chromatography, CrossLab's services and consumables, and Diagnostics and Genomics offerings. Geographically, all regions grew on a core basis with strong growth in China. Let me highlight the Q1 results by our three business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. We see continued strong global pharma demand, growth return on Academia & Government markets, and China government investment in Environmental and Food markets. All this offset continued weaknesses for new equipment purchases in the Chemical & Energy market space. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. As a reminder, in November, we closed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Integration activities are in full swing with the team excited to be part of Agilent. LSAG continued to strengthen its portfolio in Q1. We released two new refracted index detectors, the 1260 and 1290 Infinity II RID. These detectors help expand the capabilities of modern UHPLC chromatography to make difficult measurements in certain chemical, biopharma and food applications. Agilent's innovation strength was recognized in the January edition of Analytical Scientist magazine. We were honored with an innovation award for our unique LC dual-needle technology. This is a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into Agilent's LC products. The unique design enables fast injection cycles, scalable injection volumes and ultra-low carryover. Next is the Agilent CrossLab Group. We continue to see consistently strong revenue results. Our core revenue growth was 10% in Q1. Strong pharma and Chemical & Energy market demand drove growth in our services and consumables offerings. Operating margin was 22.1% for the quarter. This is up 140 basis points from a year ago. We continue to bring novel new chemistries to market. For example, we've released advanced Bio SEC family of products. These innovative new products are designed for accurate and precise size-exclusion chromatography, targeted at biopharma applications. Early adopting customers are reporting significant economic and performance benefits over any current technologies offered by our competitors. Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continues to demonstrate momentum. In Q1, DGG delivered 12% core revenue growth with strength across all of its businesses. The pathology business continued a steady trajectory to market growth rates. We see strong growth for Dako Omnis reagents and growing rev for new PD-L1 diagnostics. The companion diagnostics business also continued to demonstrate momentum. Double-digit growth in nucleic acids and genomics reflected strong demand from pharma and clinical markets and the favorable compares. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%. That's up 910 basis points from a year ago. I want to remind you that last year this business broke even in Q1 of fiscal 2015. Last year, our Dako complementary diagnostic for Bristol-Myers Squibb's, OPDIVO, was approved by the FDA for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In January of this year, the FDA approved expanded use of this PD-L1 diagnostics to include patients with melanoma. Positive PD-L1 status in melanoma has been correlated with the treatment effectiveness of Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug treatment. Agilent is the first company to provide FDA-approved tests for lung cancer and melanoma for PD-L1 markers.  Now I'll take a brief look at Agilent's revenues by end-market performance on a core basis. We saw strength in all our Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets. Continued robust demand drove pharma revenue up 19%. Growth was fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and aftermarket demand for services and consumables. Our Clinical and Diagnostics revenue was up 7% and we experienced a return to growth in Academia & Government of 4%. This growth was significantly driven by the authorization of larger research budgets in the U.S. Applied end-market performance was generally soft except for Environmental, which was up 9% driven by strength in China. Food declined 1%. Our Food market strength in China was offset by soft demand in developed countries. Chemical & Energy declined 2% driven by the well-publicized macroeconomic concerns. Let me provide an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. This is how we are driving a sustained performance. We are building a new company portfolio. We have exited unattractive businesses and are acquiring new ones to enable our growth strategies. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program is simplifying our company, making it more nimble and lowering our costs. Finally, while we are improving our execution capabilities, transforming our culture to work as one team across the entire company, we call this One Agilent. As we enter the second year of the new Agilent, here's what you can expect as we move forward. We are building a new business, one that delivers above-market growth. We will continue to target operating margin expansion. Finally, we are driving a balanced capital allocation policy that includes increased levels of free cash flow being returned to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to make tough decisions to ensure our long-term competitiveness. For example, we have just frozen our U.S. defined benefits retirement plan. This change is effective in the second half of fiscal 2016. I've also spoke with many of you about our multiple ERP systems and oversized IT environment. We continue to streamline our IT systems and infrastructure to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. While work remains, we are pleased with the start of the second year of the new Agilent and our progress in transforming the company. Let me share my view on the current market outlook. The principle of new Agilent is to be realistic and to closely monitor market conditions that could affect our business. Global macroeconomic concerns are pressuring some end-markets and emerging economies. The good news is that we see solid market conditions in other end-markets and geographies. I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year core growth and operating margin goals. I am also confident that we will make course corrections as market conditions dictate. We are strengthening our portfolio, building on our prior-year introductions, we have an exciting pipeline of compelling new offerings set to launch this year. In tandem with these new offerings, we are creating a new go-to-market capability. We have a focused, energized sales force, and we are overhauling our e-commerce environment to make it easier for customers to do business with us. And most importantly, across the company, we have the organizational capability to execute and deliver. The Agilent team is aligned and highly energized, driven to win in the marketplace. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our updated guidance. Didier? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President  Yes. Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they are above the high-end of our revenue and EPS guidance, even as currency impacted revenue by $7 million and OP by $2 million. The EPS beat was the result of the higher revenues as well as favorable mix. Our adjusted operating margin of 20.2% and operating cash flow of $106 million was strong. We bought back $200 million or 4.9 million shares in Q1. I'll turn now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. We are confirming the core revenue growth guidance of 4.0% to 4.5% we provided in November. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $50 million on reported revenues, $13 million on operating profit and $0.033 on EPS. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2016 revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.12 billion and EPS of $1.81 to $1.87. To note, in the last two weeks, we've seen the U.S. dollar weaken. If the weakening continues, we will reflect the positive impact in our May guidance. Turning to our share buyback program, we remain committed to our plan of repurchasing another $280 million of shares before our fiscal year-end. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we're expecting Q2 revenues of $965 million to $985 million, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1. The midpoint corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0%. The sequential reduction in revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS. We expect Q2 EPS to range between $0.37 to $0.39. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez - Vice President-Investor Relations Thank you, Didier, and, Jonathan, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? <p id="question-answer-session" class="p p4">Question-and-Answer Session Operator Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your question please. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC Hi. This is Ryan Blicker filling in for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. Starting with operating margin guidance, it seems as though you reduced full-year guidance by about 10 basis points, but it seems as though most of that was FX. Can you confirm that that was all due to FX, or are there other changes we should be thinking about? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President No. It was entirely due to FX, absolutely. As I mentioned, the FX impact was $13 million and that is precisely the amount of the reduction in operating profit reflected in our guidance. And we have maintained the guidance at 20.2%, which was the average of 20% to 25% that we had guided to in November. No change. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And looking at the pharma end-market, obviously, another very strong performance in the quarter. Can you give us more details on what drove the strength and were there any one-time dynamics like a budget flush or pull-forward of revenue? And, I guess, lastly, do you still expect growth in this end-market to approximate high-single-digits for the full-year? Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Ryan. This is Mike. Let me make a few comments on the pharma strength we saw in the first quarter. Clearly, no one-time events and we saw great pacing throughout the quarter. I just would highlight a few points here. One, we're seeing a strong growth in Liquid Chromatography both in terms of the uptake and our new products, but also the technology refresh that is underway within the segment. Also, customers are responding quite positively to our biopharma solutions. And across the board, between biopharma and pharma, we're seeing strong demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. 19% growth for the first quarter. We don't expect that level of double-digit growth to continue all through the year, but we're quite confident in our projections of high-single-digit. We're calling for 8% overall growth for the year in pharma. So we see no signs that this market won't remain robust for us for the rest of this year.  Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Paul. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Hey, Mike. How are you? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer I'm doing just fine. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Regarding the guidance of EPS, I know when you guided last time the euro had already fallen relative to the dollar. So are you measuring the euro on today's exchange rate, last week's exchange rate? I mean, could you flush out a little bit more? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Great question, Paul. It's the same question I ask Didier. I'm going to pass it back to Didier. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yeah. Hi, Paul. So the guidance is always based on the exchange rate on the last day of the quarter we report. So the new guidance is based on the exchange rate as of January 30 of 2016. And it was between November – October 30, which was a November guidance and then January 30, which is the present guidance. The dollar strengthened, but we are seeing it weakening since November 30 a little bit vis-à-vis the euro, and certainly, vis-à-vis the yen. So if that continues, it will be reflected in our May guidance. Again, there was no change at all to our November guidance except for those that result directly from the change in exchange rates between October 30 and January 30. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Paul, if I can just emphasize that again, I mean, the fundamental assumptions we made that underlined our prior quarter guidance remain intact with the exception being FX. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC And then, lastly, Mike, what stands out on technology is the PD-L1 approval and also the large molecule technology in CrossLab, do you sit there with those two products on your menu thinking there's a bias toward more organic? Or where are you at with those two that you mentioned? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Paul, just to make sure I understand the question relative to -thanks for the comments and observations. Just to make sure I understand the question, this would be relative to our expectation of continued organic growth of those two new... Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Yeah. Are they enough to move the needle higher than what you would have thought 90 days ago on last guide? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Well, let me make a comment on the CrossLab services and consumables, and then I'll pass it over to Jacob on the PD-L1. When we put together our guidance for the year, we were expecting strong growth in our CrossLab services and consumables business. So that's part of the reasons why we had a lot of confidence coming into this year and still have the confidence in this year about making our organic core revenue growth targets because have you seen even in the Chemical & Energy space, which is down in terms of new instrument purchases, they continue to buy and we see strong growth of services and consumables. So what I'll leave you is we expect continued strength in that space, but we were assuming that to be the case, when we guided the company earlier this year. And, Jacob, why don't you share your thoughts on the PD-L1? Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President, President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group Yeah. Thanks, Paul. And you're right that we got the indication approval also for the melanoma for the OPDIVO drug. And that's a great next step in the opportunities for PD-L1. I will not say that it really changes some needle on an Agilent level, but it definitely is a part of our growth story in DGG. But I will remind also that this drug – or this companion diagnostic has only been out now for a few months. And we're still in the early days of seeing the uptake of it. So I see good progress, but not something that really moves the needle here.  Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your question, please. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thanks for the questions. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Dan. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Mike, last quarter you mentioned that industrial weakness you were seeing spilled over into the Environmental business? I'm just wondering whether that's reversed a bit this quarter. So, I guess, is it fair to say that maybe growth in Environmental this year could be a couple of points higher than the cyclical segments? I guess, how would you just compare expectations for Environmental versus industrial for this year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Dan. Thanks for the careful observation. And actually, the Environmental business was a pleasant surprise in the first quarter. We knew that China was going to be strong and we've been talking about China and our view of investments that the Chinese government's making in places such as environmental market and food safety. But I will say that we're happy to see the growth in other segments. Because, yes, the Chemical & Energy space has been under pressure, but what we're still seeing is that fracking is still going on. So the production – while prices of oil are down, the production demand is stable. And, in fact, if you look at the gasoline production in the U.S., for example, it's perhaps going up. So we're seeing a continued need to do Environmental testing. So that's been a nice reaffirmation, if you will, of our outlook for the year, which calling for low-single-digit growth in Environmental. We thought that China would carry the whole load for us, but I think we're getting a little help from the U.S. as well. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. And then, maybe just staying in the BRIC region, any change in the way that you're thinking about Brazil and Russia and how that might end up this year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Unfortunately, no. I think we're still looking for very challenged conditions in those countries. I know there's been some recent news today about Russia, and perhaps, working with some of the other oil-producing countries to change some aspects of production. Maybe they'll have some dynamics in terms of their economy, but right now, we're assuming continuation of the current challenged conditions for Brazil and Russia. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. Okay. Thanks, Mike. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Good afternoon. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yeah. Mike, first question was on gross margin. There's pretty big year-on-year improvement there, and I was wondering if you can maybe break down the key drivers of gross margin performance. The extent to which there might have been one-time benefits and the extent to which there are some items that are going to continue as the year progresses. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Why don't I make a few high-level comments here, then, Didier, you can jump in and augment my comments. But I think one, there were some one-time improvements. And I think we highlighted those specifically as it related to DGG, where we had some revenue that was really trapped last year in the first quarter due to production issues.  But the lion's share of the improvement is resulting from our continued sustained efforts that I highlighted in my call. Both the portfolio efforts in terms of the businesses we're no longer in, the businesses we acquired are changing our gross margin profile. We're taking real cost out of our system through the Agile Agilent program. So there were some one-time events as it relates to the revenue for DGG, but the bulk of our margin improvement is from the underlying core efforts we've had over the last several quarters to fundamentally change the operating model of the company. Didier, anything else that you'd add to that? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Just to point that also contributed the number one – you will recall that last year we were spending heavily on remediation point to address the FDA warning letters. So that is now we're spending significant amounts to maintain our strong position now, but certainly, not in the same magnitude of what we have spent for two years in a row. And then, the second point is there was a favorable mix. We talked about how strong the pharma business is and pharma does generate higher gross margin than the rest of the businesses. So favorable mix and the pharma being just one of them, but a significant one. And then, the FDA, the reduction of FDA spend also in addition to all the points that Mike has made. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up on CrossLab. You mentioned the driver there, looking like it was just healthy demand in the end-market. But I don't think of that business as necessarily having a sustainable growth rate in that double-digit range. So I'm wondering if there was an element of market share that was helpful. It's just not a market where we have a ton of quarter-to-quarter visibility, so I was wondering if you could put some color around the extent to which market share was helpful and how you'd characterize where it's coming from. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Great question. I'll make a few comments, and Mark, why don't you jump in with your thoughts here? As we looked at the overall growth rate for CrossLab, you should assume that we're right in the range, where we talked about at the AID, and we think there's both market growth, but as you pointed out, market share gain opportunities for us, where we really have changed our view of what the addressable market is for our business and it's no longer the Agilent install base, but it's the entire lab. And, Mark, why don't you talk about some of the things we're doing in terms of capturing market share? Mark Doak - Senior Vice President and President-Agilent CrossLab Group Thanks, Mike. And I think you hit on the primary piece, which is we continue to see the primary drivers in pharma, and also, China has been very strong for us. When you pull it all back to when capital spending is constrained, we continue to see customers improve the productivity of their assets through services and the chemistries we talked about earlier. But I think what's more robust than it was a year ago even is really the strength of our multi-vendor and enterprise portfolio. And that does allow you to take share, if you will, from the broader market. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. Appreciate all the color, guys. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Quite welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Good afternoon. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI  So I'm just trying to double-check on the guidance map here, because I think a few of us are a little bit confused. So we beat the quarter, right, by around – I don't know – call it, $0.03. We lost $0.033 on FX roughly, and the range came down $0.04. So I'm just trying to get a sense for – again, it seems like FX was the key delta, but just the simple math would have suggested to me a little less downward pressure on the full-year range. And again, I realize there's probably a few other moving parts. So I'm just trying to make sure I understand how we're doing versus the plan for the year. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. We're happy to – Didier would be happy to clarify. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, we have reduced our top line revenue from a midpoint from $4.160 billion to $4.110 billion, which is a $50 million reduction. We've reduced our operating profit from $830 million to $817 million. That's $13 million, and that's entirely due to the impact of the strengthening of the dollar and related to the $50 million. And then, I mentioned $0.033, but with rounding, we are going from the midpoint of $1.88 to the midpoint of $1.84, and that's $0.04, and that's the $0.033, which is rounded because of the – going from one to the other, you can understand that. So basically, what we felt is even though we are starting the year very strongly, we felt that with the overall macroeconomic condition, it would not be wise at this point in time to change the guidance we have provided, core revenue guidance of 4% to 4.5%. We have the same confidence as we had in the month of November, when we provided that guidance that we're in good shape to hit it and perhaps beat it, but certainly, didn't want to change it. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI Yeah. I guess, what I'm trying to get at is sort of the comments last quarter suggested sort of conservatism, right. You obviously can't control what happens with the dollar, so that's understandable. I'm just trying to get a sense for how much conservatism there is now in the forecast and whether or not we have risk to that core growth rate, given again that the range came down, but you reiterated the top line. Just making sure that we're sort of not over-extrapolating here. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Sure, Ross. This is Mike. I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this. So if you go by the conservatism meter on our guidance, it's at the same level as it was last quarter. So the only real fundamental changes from our outlook is the view on FX. That's it. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President And that we saw no reason to change our core revenue growth to offset a part of the FX, because FX can go up and down and it's too volatile nowadays to immediately – unless we see some long-term structural changes, as we have last year and we reacted accordingly. We were not going to react by what we believe are temporary changes in FX by actions on our structural spend. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI Okay. So, sorry. I'm going to monopolize for a minute, just because I'm trying to make sure my inbox lights up. I'm getting everyone the answers they need. So all right. To be clear, we have the FX hit. I'd love to also understand what were the key currencies, because most of us can see the dollar's actually, again, we'll see if it sustains, weakened a bit. And so it seems like it's outside the euro and the yen that might have caused some of the headwinds. So I'd love to hear just a little bit of color on maybe it's the yuan or some of the other emerging market currencies. And just to be clear also on the second point, so we didn't really bake in the beat from this quarter. Is that where the conservatism comes in? And then, I'm done I promise. I'll cede the floor.  Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yeah. I mean, in terms of the currencies we have a detailed model that takes into account obviously all the currencies. The dollar versus the euro or the dollar versus the yen had a major impact also, I think, dollar versus the British pound. And again, I mean, today's guidance is based on the January 30 exchange rate, so the euro to dollar €0.84 and the yen – and vis-à-vis the yen at the U.S. dollar is ¥121.4 and we are seeing that at today's rate if we had to provide the guidance based on just if we had to – we're able to instantly reflect the currencies as of the day of the guidance, we'd have a very different guidance. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer And I think your second statement is probably a fair one. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI Okay. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your question please. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Yeah. Thanks for the question. So question for Mike on Chemical & Energy. You were down 2% this quarter. The last couple of quarters you were down 9% or 10%. I guess, can you give us a sense for what's happening on the E&P side? You talked about stability on the refining side, but what are you seeing on the E&P side. It seems like that's what allowed the – I guess, the improvement relative to last couple of quarters. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Actually, it's probably worth maybe just doing a little bridge on the last few quarters, because, in fact, we've seen relative flat performance over the last several quarters. And while instruments were down the percentage you were talking about, high-single-digits, we've seen a continuing ability to offset through services and consumables. So what I would say is that the Chemical & Energy market is sort of playing out the way we had expected for the year. So we wish we had a different story here, but the oil price is low as you know, but the product demand still remains pretty strong for our customers' products. So the refineries are running, the chemical plants are running, and then we're really trying to sell to them new equipment based on a productivity message, but at the same point in time, recognize that if they use the equipment longer, it's a good opportunity for us on the services and consumable side. One thing I would ask you to reflect on is that Q1 2015, as you dig into some of the numbers, Q1 2015 really was our best quarter for the whole year. I think we grew 3% in the first quarter of last year on a core basis. We ended up growing, I think, 1% for the whole year so that shows you were declining through the year. And so I wouldn't over-interpret the numbers. We think it's right in the range where we thought. And, Patrick, I don't know if you had any other comments you'd add to that? Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group Well, no, not really. I think, as you said, it's playing out as we expected. There's continued pressure on the exploration side and production side. But for the refinery side, demand really drives. Also, replacement business for us, we try to incentivize our customers and give them opportunity to upgrade to increase their productivity and efficiency. And on the chemical side, I would say that the lower feedstock prices have not yet fully materialized. So we stay with focus for the year to – for the whole segment to stay flat. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Okay. And, Jeff, this is Mike. I think we shared these numbers with you in the past. But the way we looked at this – we always look at our business, say, about 15% or so is in E&P, as you described, exploration and production, which will be about 3% to 4% of our total revenues. About 35% of that segment is in refining and the other 50% is in chemicals. So that's how we – it remains stable at a subdued level.  Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the questions here. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Good afternoon. Our pleasure. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC I'd like to follow up just a bit on the pharmaceutical space. It was really helpful to hear just how confident you guys are in the outlook for the year growing 8% in pharma. I wondered if you can maybe add a little bit to the conversation, though, and talk about what you're hearing, Mike or Patrick, in your conversations with pharma customers as they talk about their budgets for this year? I apologize for coming back to the topic, but there's a lot of interest out there in the sustainability of growth in the space. So any color you could offer on how your customers are thinking would be really helpful. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Absolutely. So, Patrick, why don't you take that question and I have one closing comment. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group Sure. Thanks. So what we're hearing from our customers is that actually they are holding their budgets. We don't see any significant reduction there. And this comes, by the way, across the board from small and medium-sized and large enterprises. So it's really for us, it's a good mixture between different sized companies and also between the different markets. Talking about small molecule versus biopharmaceuticals, the growth really comes from both sides. And this is why we're so confident that we will maintain to see this high-single-digit growth for pharma. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer And the other thing that we've done, so we're getting broad-based demand across all segments of the market. Then we also continue to do our own math in terms of what's out there, in terms of the install base of our products. So we have a pretty good idea of – at least on the technology refresh side how much more demand we can expect in the segment. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC That's extremely helpful. One corollary, one follow-up there. I wonder if you could give us a sense for, to what extent, the success that you're having in pharma and the success that you're having in CrossLab are interrelated. Are those two perhaps a little bit more overlapping than CrossLab as with some of the other customer verticals? And to what extent, is one dependent on the other? Thanks so much. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Great question. Happy to elaborate. They are highly connected. So when we talk about pharma market demand, it's both driving new equipment purchases, which were the focus on Patrick's comments, but also, there's a demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. But on the CrossLab side, not only are they investing in ongoing chemistries and services to maintain their operations and support their application needs, what we're also seeing is a change in the model. So what they're doing is they are taking activities that historically have been done inside the company and are creating, if you will, a new set of services for vendors in our space to handle things such as asset management. And that's creating a new set of services that are being created right now in pharma. We haven't seen that new set of services demand develop yet on the Chemical & Energy side, but we're hopeful that it will down the road. But there's a couple of dynamics going on in the pharma space, which are driving both the new instrument purchases and the consumables and services from CrossLab.  Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC That's super helpful. Thanks, everyone. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Wondered if you could give us a update on market for tuck-in acquisitions. What you're thinking about these days in terms of where you might like to plug some holes. And also, are you seeing more opportunities now that some valuations have come in? Thanks. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Appreciate the opportunity to provide a perspective on here. So although we remain focused on our organic growth opportunities, we've got a lot of very exciting plans and new products coming out, and working on the go-to-market capabilities I mentioned in my call comments. We're really continuing to look for acquisitions that augment our current portfolio and add to our company capabilities. And so I think you saw doing the Seahorse deal, where we added capabilities in life science, research, Cartagenia in the area of next-gen sequencing. We built out our workflow there. We'd still like to find ways to build out our workflow in next-gen sequencing. And so our stated strategies of really adding capabilities, expanding our portfolio, building on our workflow solutions with particular emphasis on life sciences, research, next-gen sequencing workflows in the overall consumables and services place, they're our priorities. Well, that being said, most people still have the memories of the 52-week highs. So we'll see how this plays out. And what I will tell you is we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we think about M&A and does it provide an attractive return to our shareholders, and can we do something to make the business better? If we can't make the business better, it's not something we'd be interested in. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your question, please. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC Thanks. Good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Good afternoon, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC Mike, you pointed to strength in China in the period. Just curious, if you could elaborate on the actual growth rate in the first quarter and if there's been any deviation from the mid- to high-single-digit target for the year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about China; one of my favorite topics. So we saw a very good demand in China, high-single-digit growth in our analytical lab business. And as I mentioned to you in the past, the markets here are really being driven by strong investments in government policy-driven initiatives around quality of life concerns, whether the environment, drug and food safety. So all the markets with the exception of Chemical & Energy really saw quite strong growth. And we're underpenetrated in DGG business compared to the rest of the company. We've talked about that in the past. And we're underpenetrated in a growing market for cancer diagnostics, for example. And I recently saw some statistics that I thought were really quite amazing. There was a report by the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said that every minute an average of six people in the country were diagnosed with cancer, and five of those six would eventually die of the disease. So unfortunately, there's going to be growing demand for cancer diagnostics as well. I'm going to wrap this all up by saying we remain quite comfortable with the mid- to high-single-digit growth expectation we laid out for China. It was strong for us in the first quarter and we expect that to continue through the year.  Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC Then one more for Didier. Could you split out the contribution from Seahorse relative to the headwind from the NMR in the first quarter in terms of just dollars? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President No, no, no, we don't provide guidance or information regarding the acquisitions. We have stated and we are exactly in line that we expect Seahorse revenue to grow double-digits in 2016 versus 2015. And we expect the Seahorse operating margin to be also in the double-digits. So no change to our expectations. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer And, Patrick, maybe you can just add a few comments on how is it going so far. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group Well, the integration of Seahorse is going very well. It's giving us extended reach also into the research market, and this was the whole play. Plus, we, of course, used the opportunity to use our strength in pharma to sell these products into the pharma space in areas like disease discovery as well. And this will drive the growth in fiscal year 2016. As Didier said, we expect double-digit growth. We have the salesforce trained and we are looking forward to a very strong Q2, Q3, Q4 for this product line. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC Super. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. How are you? Maybe just first on capital deployment, you did $200 million in buybacks in the quarter. You guided for $480 million for the year. I mean, it sounds like you all front-end loaded, and I mean, how do we think about a reauthorization once you get through this tranche, given your stock's probably under some pressure tomorrow? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yeah. We basically decided to buy back in Q1 what we had not been able to do in Q4 of the preceding year. And then, we have filed a 10b5-1 with certain formula. But for your model, you should assume that we are buying about one-third of the remaining $280 million per quarter. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC And then, just to clarify on the margins, because I've had a few questions. I mean, the $13 million hit is the FX hit, but, I guess, people are having a hard time understanding why you're not seeing faster-than-expected realization of the COGS and SG&A cuts that we saw some of that this quarter. Why doesn't that carry through for the next three quarters? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President We're not saying it's not going to carry us through. We're saying we saw no reason in the present environment to change the guidance on an operating margin basis, 20.2% that we had provided, 20% to 20.5% that we had provided previously, and again, with the same level of conservatism as we had in November. So that's basically the – that was the premise for us maintaining both the core revenue growth and the operating margin we had provided in November. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer And, Didier, I'd just add, in my call comments, I tried to highlight a few things on a longer-term nature to show you that we're not out of gas in this tank in terms of our ability to continue to move our operating margin. We have other larger-hitting programs that are coming in late 2016 and will carry on into 2017 as well. So this is not a one-time quarter where we just got a favorable mix, whatever. There's real fundamental improvements underway in the operating margin capabilities of the company. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC  And then, I guess, speaking of running out of gas, you talked about refiners holding up. There's been news that at least two of the country's largest refiners are cutting output of gasoline. What gives you conviction that your business there holds up? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to, but relative to our view is that gasoline will continue to be needed to run the economy, and there's going to be demand there. And what we've tried to share, as long as production is running and there's demand, the refineries will meet that demand. So we've seen no significant changes in the underlying demand for gas. And, in fact, Patrick, I think you were showing me some statistics the other day about what's going on in the area of refineries in the U.S. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group Yeah. I mean, what we see, as Mike said, is the continued demand for – not only in the U.S., but also in the emerging economies like China. So the refineries are basically running at capacity right now. There will be no new builds, but we see that they've replaced existing equipment, and they also go into service contracts with us. They look for opportunities to drive more efficiencies, which gives us an opportunity to upgrade the install base with automation features and other things to make sure that the customers can save money with the equipment as well. So the oil price is clearly driven by the fact that there's overcapacity on the production side. But the refinery volume has not gone down significantly over the last quarters. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, just lastly, can you talk about linearity in the quarter? Anything notable in January? You guys have an extra month versus a lot of your comps, so just wondering if there's anything worth calling out in January trends versus November and December? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. No, I'd just point to two things. One is in terms of our normal seasonality through the quarter. Q1 of 2016 was like prior quarters. We always see a nice strong December as we close off year-end with our customers. And followed our typical seasonality patterns through November, December and January. I think probably the only thing of note would be in the DDG side. We had, I think, one less working day, I think, this year. So that does affect the Genomics business in terms of how much revenue we get in that quarter. But really, it was business as usual, if you will, through the first quarter. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC All right. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your question please. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on Tycho's last question, just around the academic end-market. I'm curious, you mentioned in the presentation around some of the modestly larger research budgets being released in the U.S. Curious on your view on the NIH and really timing-related there, because of the timing of the Congressional approvals at year-end. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group Yeah. I can take this question here. We have seen moderate growth again in Academia & Government, which was a positive surprise. And as you all have read, there are more budgets available now in the U.S. These budgets are slowly released and drove some of the growth for us in Q1. And looking at the funnel moving forward, we actually see a good funnel there as well. So we stay with the forecast of low-single-digit growth for Academia & Government, at the moment, mainly driven by the U.S., which is where we see the strongest demand.  Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it. And are your expectations for this level of growth to stay at the same rate through the end of the fiscal year? Are you assuming the budgets get released a little bit faster from here? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer If the budgets were to be released faster, I think, it would probably be upside for us. Our current view is low-single-digits for Academia & Government for the year. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it. And then, just one other question on the margins in DGG, definitely appreciate the year-over-year improvement. I was wondering what your thoughts were bridging through the end of the year just given how the relative margins compared to the end of 2015. Thanks. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Great. I know Jacob's given a lot of thought to that potential question. So I'll pass it over to you, Jacob, to provide some color there. Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President, President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group Yeah. Thanks for that, Jack, and first of all, I want to say that very pleased to see the improvement versus the Q1 last year, but you're also right that versus Q4 that we saw a bit of a decrease and that was actually where most expected. We sit in the DGG business with a pretty fixed cost base. So when you have a Q1 with the lower base than in Q4, you will see that our margins has also impacted economy. So you always see us coming out with a strong Q4 and a weaker Q1 and the gross margin also on our operating margin. So it's kind of by the book and really as expected. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yeah. I would just add that there's no change in plan and Jacob is still absolutely committed to reaching 20% operating margin in 2017. Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President, President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group Absolutely. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your question please. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Good afternoon, Derik. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch So I'm just curious. You're guiding to a 22% operating margin for 2017, so that's implying – assuming the 20.2% midpoint, 130 basis points to 180 basis points of margin expansion next year. I'm just curious, if you couldn't find 10 additional basis points of margin expansion in 2016 to offset the impact, what gives you confidence you're going to be able to get 130 basis points, 180 basis points next year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer I'd just reiterate – great question this one. Again by the way, one of the things as you heard me say earlier in my comments, we continue to make sure we're realistic and we think about our business not on some hope and a prayer, but we actually have solid plans behind our long-term operating goals. And I think we have a lot of confidence for two reasons. One is we have a plan that can get us there with not all the top line, it's probably in the range of 4% ago, we can get to the margin goals. We've laid out a plan that's got 60% of this coming from the cost side. And we have multi-year programs that are going to take significant cost out of our structure. So I highlighted a field in my call, I mean, changes in terms of our benefit structure, changes in terms of our IT cost, our IT systems. It is a major company-wide initiatives that right now we're underway. You won't start to see them going through the P&L until like late 2016 going into 2017. So these are the kind of things that give us confidence to say, okay, there's a path that gets us to where we want to get to in 2017.  Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great. It was the late 2016, early 2017 that, I think, that was the key that I was looking for in that. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Okay. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Second question. Second question is given some of the turmoil going on in Europe, have you seen any changes in the academic or government spending like the governments grapple with the refugee crisis and everything that's going on? Is there any noticeable change to spending patterns in Europe? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Patrick, you're... Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group Yeah. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer You're shaking your head here right now. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group I'm shaking my head because we have not seen any significant change over the last several quarters. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer You're quite welcome, Derik. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Partners. Your question, please. Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC Hey, guys. All my questions have been asked. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Dan. That was fast. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from BTIG. Your question, please. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So on the gross margin line, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of the product mix? As I look at the different groups really the margin leverage seem to come through the Life Sci and Applied Markets Group. You guys almost reported a 59% gross margin there. Comment on the mix, please, and why margin for that Group specifically is expected to moderate when, I guess, historically it's been pretty steady quarter-to-quarter throughout the year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer I think there are two things I would point to and then, Didier, feel free to jump in in as well. But first of all, remember, the change we're making to our portfolio. So we've exited the NMR hardware business and we're starting to see some of those margin improvements shown on the P&L where we had revenue in the NMR business and much higher revenues in FY 2015. And then, our pharma business is pulling a lot of Liquid Chromatography, which is one of our highest gross margin products. I think it's really perhaps those are the things... Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President You said it all. Absolutely. I had mentioned earlier that the favorable mix came in part from the pharma mix. And within pharma, clearly Liquid Chromatography has the higher-than-average operating margin and gross margin. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC So to clarify, you felt that there was either a catch-up ordering or stocking in the quarter on those products specifically that's not expected to continue for the rest of the year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Well, you can almost think about pharma – we had 19% pharmaceutical growth in the first quarter. What we're saying is we can't expect 19% to happen each of the next three quarters, what we do expect is continued strong demand, and right now, we're calling 8% for the entire year. So that's what you're seeing in terms of reflected in our mix column as it relates to gross margin. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC Okay. And then, on the FX rate, so if you just use the DXY proxy, right, the last quarter was actually pretty elevated, but since then, the trend has actually come back into closer to where you guided the year. Are you expecting – is there some nuance within this on how certain currencies have moved? Or are you just assuming worst-case that the dollar goes back up here?  Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer It's just pure math. So we're not making any projections at all about future levels of FX. What Didier has done is, he takes the currency spot rates on the last day of the reported quarter, and that's how we guide the company. We say okay, that's what we know and we'll assume that rate stays the same the rest of the year, and then, it's just pure math from there. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President That's been same methodology for ever. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC Okay. So it's an extrapolation off of January 31, not what's happening in February? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Exactly. That's correct. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC Okay. Got it. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President And that's why I made a comment on my script that would we had used, for example, today's exchange rates, the guidance would have been higher, because the dollar between January 31 and today has weakened. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer Very welcome. Operator Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Alicia Rodriguez - Vice President-Investor Relations All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call. And if you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. We'd like to wish you a good day, and I'm sure we'll be talking later. Thank you. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen Thanks Alicia, and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us on today’s call. Our new Agilent team had a strong year. Let me start by highlighting our fourth quarter performance, focusing on three key numbers.  First, revenue is up 6.2% on a core basis. Second, adjusted operating margin is up 150 basis points to 21.9%. Finally, EPS of $0.50 is above the high end of our guidance.  Now I would like to talk about our full-year results. For the full-year, our core revenue is up 6.4%. It is worth noting that this is our highest annual core growth rate since 2011. Adjusted operating margin is up 80 basis points to 19.6% and EPS of $1.74 is above the midpoint of both our November 2014 and August 2015 guidance.  We offset significant FX headwinds and $40 million of dis-synergies from the spin-off of our electronic measurement business. Our fourth quarter capped off a stellar performance by the team in our first year of the New Agilent. This team has not skipped a beat as we’ve navigated through a CEO transition, implemented a new strategy and dealt with changing market conditions. Both our fourth-quarter and full-year results demonstrate our commitment to drive both growth and operating margin expansion.  Now let me move on to more details on what is going on within the business. Our Q4 results are driven by strength in the pharma, diagnostics, clinical and food markets. Geographically, we saw core growth across all regions, with particular strength in our liquid chromatography offerings, CrossLab services and consumables, and diagnostics and genomics products. Let me highlight the Q4 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. Strong performance in Pharma was offset by softness in the industrial and academia & government markets. LSAG’s operating margin for the quarter was 20%, down 20 basis points from a year ago.  In November, Agilent closed its acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Seahorse is a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics. Seahorse’s unique technology is the perfect complement to Agilent’s market-leading separations and mass spec solutions, in particular for metabolomics and disease research in pharma. The combination of these two platforms gives scientists a more comprehensive and faster path to researching some of the most challenging diseases affecting mankind. Seahorse will be incorporated into Agilent’s financials starting in the first fiscal quarter of 2016. In Q4, Agilent started shipping the new 1290 Infinity II Vialsampler, as well as the 600-bar 1260 Infinity version. At the BCEIA Conference in Beijing, we introduced the Agilent 5977B High-Efficiency Source GC/MSD System, a tandem gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer that delivers lower levels of detection than any other instrument in its class.  We also introduced the 4200 TapeStation system. This fully automated instrument enables scientists to rapidly analyze up to 96 DNA samples at a time, and sets a new sample QC standard for next-gen sequencing; and we also launched several targeted solutions, such as our GC QTOF Pesticide Analysis Solution, and our LC QTOF Water Analysis System. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group delivered another strong quarter, with core revenue growth of 11% in Q4. Both services and consumables experienced strong growth across all geographies. Operating margin was 25.1% for the quarter, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Customers are benefitting from ACG’s new brand promise to deliver insights that lead to outcomes. In Q4, Agilent University introduced an enhanced portfolio of online training courses. This enables customers from lab technicians to researchers, to develop new skills and gain insights that can improve economic, operational and scientific outcomes for their laboratories. The launch of the online training has exceeded our expectations.  In consumables, we introduced a new product to help food-safety labs test high-fat samples more accurately. The Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid removes matrix interferences that have made test results challenging to reproduce. This gives food-safety labs a better way to address what has been one of their most challenging tasks.   Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued to build momentum in Q4, delivering 10% core revenue growth and strength across all of its businesses. Target enrichment was particularly strong, while Dako Omnis once again had record shipments and it continues to gain competitive wins.  DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 19.2%, up 430 basis points from a year ago. In the fourth quarter, two new diagnostics products from DGG received FDA approval. The first product was created in partnership with Merck & Co. This new companion diagnostic test can reveal whether a patient with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is likely to respond to Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA.  The second product is our first complementary diagnostic developed in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. This new test can identify PD-L1 expression levels on the surface of non-small-cell lung cancer tumor cells, and provide information on the survival benefit with OPDIVO for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. Now, let’s take a brief look at Agilent’s revenues by end-market performance on a core basis. Life sciences and diagnostics markets continue to see ongoing strength in the pharma, diagnostics and clinical markets, fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptick and healthy demand across the spectrum.  Spending in Academia & Government was down versus an extremely strong Q4,’14.  Applied end-market performance was led by continued growth in food and environmental and chemical & energy were flat on a core basis. As we noted in our Q3 call, customers in the industrial markets continue to take a cautious stance, in light of weakening commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economy. Geographically, we saw core revenue growth across all regions led by the U.S. and Asia, excluding Japan.  Now let me provide some additional insight on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program launched in Q2 is re-engineering the company to be more nimble and efficient. In fiscal 2015 our actions delivered about $40 million in gross savings. In addition, the NMR closed resulted in $15 million in savings, and our Agilent Order fulfillment organization delivered on its $25 million committed savings.  The Agile Agilent program and order fulfillment cost savings will be key drivers behind continued operating margin expansion. We remain on track to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY17, a 4 point improvement over FY14, exclusive of company split dis-synergies. At the same time we continue to invest in long-term revenue growth. Our results over the past three quarters give us confidence in our ability to deliver on this longer-term operating margin expansion commitment. We are pleased with the operational results for our first year as the New Agilent Technologies, and our ability to meet our external earnings commitments for the full year.  Now I want to tell you about how we think about our guidance. We are committed to achieving our long-term financial goals. At the same time, we will be more conservative in our guidance. This is especially prudent due to macro-market concerns that have developed since I spoke with many of you at our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting. Before turning the call over to Didier, I want to recap a few highlights of our first year as the New Agilent Technologies. This was a transformational year for the company. We successfully completed the CEO transition. We formed a new executive leadership team that is deeply committed to delivering results. We have also implemented a new company strategy, restructured the company’s operations and product portfolio, and committed to new long-term financial goals. Despite all this change and moving pieces, we have delivered growth and increasing profitability over the past three quarters.   Let me close with a few comments about the future. We are making acquisitions such as Cartagenia and Seahorse, expanding our presence in served life sciences and diagnostics markets. Our pipeline of new offerings has never been stronger. I am convinced we have an energized, aligned team at Agilent that will deliver on our full potential. I remain quite confident in our long-term prospects of above-market growth, increasing profitability levels, and greater shareholder value. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our FY16 guidance. Didier. Didier Hirsch Thank you Mike and hello everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full-year performance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.2% and 6.4% respectively, and our operating margin adjusted for income from Keysight was 21.9% and 19.6% respectively.  Excluding the $40 million annual cost dis-synergies resulting from the Keysight spinoff, our operating margin was up 240 basis points in Q4 and up 170 basis points for the full year. We are therefore well on our way to deliver on the committed 400 basis points improvement in adjusted operating margin by fiscal year ‘17. Our hedging strategy, consisting of both structural and systematic financial hedges was put to the test this year and delivered very well. Thanks to structural hedging stemming from our global footprint, flow-through was just 20% and we also gained $18 million from our systematic cash flow hedges.  Turning to capital returns and cash flow for the year, we returned $400 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks and generated $491 million in operating cash flow. We did not repurchase stock in the fourth quarter, but we intend to repurchase this quarter, subject to customary conditions. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year ‘16 revenue guidance of $4.15 billion to $4.17 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0% to 4.5%. It is based on October 30 exchange rates and takes into account the Cartagenia and Seahorse acquisitions, as well as the XRD divestiture and NMR exit. We expect currency will have a 1.7% negative impact on revenues.  Regarding XRD and NMR, fiscal year ‘15 revenues were $58 million and fiscal year ‘16 revenues are expected to be $12 million. We project fiscal year ‘16 EPS to range from $1.85 to $1.91, growing 6% to 10 %, based on an adjusted operating margin of 20.0% to 20.5%. You will notice that we are projecting a narrow revenue and EPS range at this time. We believe that 4.3% core revenue growth and 20.3% adjusted operating margin are the proper midpoints, taking into account both the present macroeconomic environment and our operating margin commitments. With those midpoints, we want to set the low end of our guidance in line with our commitments. Having set those at 4.0% core revenue growth and 20% adjusted operating margin, the high-end of the guidance naturally falls out at 4.5% core revenue growth and 20.5% adjusted operating margin. As you adjust your models for fiscal year ‘16, please consider the following nine points; first, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2015. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $57 million and as we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $22 million. Depreciation is projected to be – that is the third point, depreciation is projected to be $100 million for the fiscal year. Fourth point, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be 20%. Fifth, we plan to return approximately $635 million in capital to shareholders, including $155 million in dividends and $480 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions.  Six, as communicated at the Analyst and Investor Day in May, we plan to borrow $250 million around February to fund a portion of our buyback program. Seven, net interest expense is forecasted at $68 million, and other income at $7 million, including $12 million billed to Keysight. Eight, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 328 million shares, 7 million less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year ’15. And ninth and last, we expect operating cash flow of $650 million and capital expenditures of $140 million, $42 million over fiscal year ‘15 as we embark on a two-year program to significantly increase the capacity of our nucleic acid facilities.  Now, finally moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1 billion to $1.02 billion and EPS of $0.42 to $0.44. At midpoint, revenue will grow 3.5% year-over-year on a core basis, and EPS will grow 5%. As customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the front-loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous semester. With that, I will turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez  Thank you, Didier. Sabrina, will you please give the instructions of the Q&A.  <p id="question-answer-session" class="p p5">Question-and-Answer Session  Operator Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.  Isaac Ro Good afternoon, thanks very much. I think you guys mentioned in the script a couple of times the fact that you are taking a more conservative approach to guidance this year. So Mike, wondering if could just put a little more color around how your process around guidance has changed this year. Just want to get a better appreciation for what you guys are doing different when it comes to planning for guidance? Mike McMullen Yes, thanks Isaac. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on our philosophy around the thinking behind the guidance. As you know I mentioned earlier, this is the first year the New Agilent Technologies. It is also my first year in the CEO seat and I had a chance to reflect on how we have guided the company over the last year.  And what I decided to do was really take a, if you will a more prudent and conservative outlook to our guidance and a couple of factors were in my thinking. One is, first the world has really changed since May when we spoke to the group about the longer term outlook for the company’s growth and the macro outlook has come a lot more challenging since then.  We’ve seen IMF grow on the GDP and some of our larger chemical customers who have taken down their outlook for ’16 and I thought just bringing down the guidance of bid in terms of the top-line mid-point or half point or so was a prudent way to plan for the company. We’ll take a look at the business as it develops over the quarter or two, but really wanted to take a more prudent and conservative outlook into 2016.  I will also remind you that we are not altering our commitments to achieving our 22% operating margin by 2017 and then the number of the conversations over the last several months, we’ve indicated that we can make those margin improvements even at a 4% top line revenue growth scenario. And then maybe just one final note here, as a reminder when we provide guidance, our internal plans are always higher and that’s our executives are compensated within the company.  So hopefully the additional color will help in terms of understating our thinking a little bit more deeply, Isaac.  Isaac Ro Okay, thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up on a couple of details. One would be, can you disclose a growth rate in China this quarter and secondly, in DDG it looks like gross margin was down a little bit sequentially on a higher based of revenue than you had in fiscal 3Q, so I’m just wondering what's going on in that business. Thank you.  Mike McMullen Sure, how about if I go ahead and make some commentary on China, then Jacob if you can chime in on the DDG specific questions. So, the results came in China just as we expected. We exited the year in mid-single digit growth rate for the year. Finished the year very strongly in China and we do this as a source of growth for the company. I think you may really, we I think are one of the first to call an early return to growth about this time last year.  For me whether it goes to mid to high single digit range, it will really be depended on what happens in the chemical and energy space. That really is the wildcard I think for our overall growth rate in China next year. But the business developed as forecasted and we are quite pleased with how we ended the year. And with that, I’ll pass it over to Jacob on the DGG question.  Jacob Thaysen Yes, hi Isaac. Yes, you’re right that our gross margin came down a little bit and it’s really due to the mix that we in Q3 had higher number of ratings and we had a little bit higher number of instruments in Q4. But that’s just the variability between the quarters and nothing you can say fundamentally has changed.  Isaac Ro Thanks so much guys. I appreciate it.  Mike McMullen Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Ross Muken  Good afternoon guys. So I guess, as you think about sort of the key delta you started – stick on the guidance topic, but the key dealt sort of today versus the Analyst Day or even versus where you were maybe a month or two ago, where would you sort of point out the significant assumption changes were? Weather it was top line and then can you just flow that through, because it does look like still even though you are delivering on the multiyear cost, the next year operating margin targets are a bit lower.  And then if you have any sense of where the delta is versus the street, because in our math based on the consensus it looks like there was a bit higher of other income assumption. So we are just trying to figure out if that was one of the deltas again versus maybe what the market was looking for? Mike McMullen Yes, thanks Ross. I appreciate the question. So relative to how your thinking has evolved since the May, I think I would point to two things; one is the chemical and energy space. This is the fourth quarter in a row for us in terms of flat growth and now it’s still a robudence [ph] in our environmental business because we are really not getting the same volume and that was associated with the fracking in the U.S. That’s the one where we’ve kind of pushed out the timing in terms of the return of growth. The business is holding steady, but is not yet to a growth trajectory.  So I think point one would be kind of a longer timeline in terms of the return to growth in the chemical and energy sector and then the other one is the impact, what we are seeing in some of the emerging economics, Brazil, Russia continue to be quite weak for us, albeit we have good strength in India and as I mentioned earlier China. And I think third was just an outlook of being a little bit more conservative and prudent on our overall guidance assumptions. And Didier, I think Ross’s math is correct on other income, but would you like to add some comments on that.  Didier Hirsch  Yes Ross, we are looking at the – we also analyzed the delta versus the consensus and it seems to come from a little bit from the revenue side, probably not taking into account the reduction due to RPD, so a little bit on that. A little bit on the operating margin percentage and a quite significant number surprisingly on other income and expense.  And I must say, you are the only one who nailed that number exactly, precisely and we’ve seen that in other cases quite significant differences in other income and expense. And I remind everybody that especially net interest expense this year we incurred $59 million. We say that we are going to borrow $250 million. We have modeled to borrow it at the middle of February and therefore we’ll add about $9 million of interest expense. So basically I think those were the main factors.  Ross Muken  All right, great. And I guess maybe secondarily, so I feel it’s unusual you guys didn’t buy any stock in the quarter. Can you give us a sort of sense? It seems like the assumption is that will obviously occur in ’16. Give us a sense for why that was? Was it Seahorse, was it something else, and then it looked like free cash came in a little bit below or a reasonable amount below what you were looking for. Can you just walk us through sort of where that delta was versus kind of what you laid out? Mike McMullen Hey Ross, this is Mike. Well I’ll go ahead and handle the first part of the question and then I’ll bounce it back to you Didier for the second part of the Ross’s question. So hey Ross, I do really appreciate the question, but we are not really in a position to comment on the circumstances around the stock repurchases in to Q4. But I would remind you is that are going to resume repurchase this quarter and as Didier mentioned in his remarks, I believe we are targeting $480 million of repurchases in 2016. And Didier can you address the second quarter.  Didier Hirsch  Yes, on the cash flow basis your correct. When we started the year, we talked about $600 million of operating cash flow and now we are at $500 million. But already at the Analyst Day we had adjusted that number, although we provided a number excluding one-time items, but it was if I recall $555 million and since then I mean we’ve been exactly in line with the commitment. So the number is about $500 million. The reason why it’s down from the initial estimate is mostly related to currency, mostly that’s what it is. And again, we are in line with our commitment since the analysis day.  Ross Muken  Great. Thank you for the candor, Mike and thanks Didier. Mike McMullen You’re quite welcome Ross. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of, John Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open. John Groberg Great, thanks. Mike, on the outlook again, I know you are no longer commenting explicitly on orders and backlog like you were previously. But as you go into next year, was there anything from an orders standpoint that gives you a little bit more caution in ‘16 or is it just the dynamics you just read previously, wanted to be a little bit more conservative? Mike McMullen Thank you John and I do really appreciate the question, but as we mentioned previously, we are no longer reporting on coming in orders. But I would say that the guidance reflects of you, of conservatism, not any concerns on the order front. John Groberg Okay, and then last one for me, if you look at the Life Science & Applied Markets Group, I think the operating margin there was down 20 basis points. Can you maybe just dig into a little bit more detail about that business? Mike McMullen Sure John, I think I’m going to go ahead and pass it over to Patrick to add this comments.  Patrick Kaltenbach Sure, thanks Mike. Regarding the operating margin you have to realize that we first and foremost had all sort of dis-synergies of this plate, which brought us down about a 1% compared to last year. And then if we look at the product mix that we have this quarter, it was a little bit different that the quarters before in terms of we had less cheesy, given the exposure we had in the oil industry, in the chemical and energy market and a little bit while other pieces in spectroscopy came up. So product mix had also a minor impact, but the biggest one you have seen is probably through there, because of the dis-synergies.  John Groberg Okay, great. I’ll hop back in the queue for others. Thanks.  Mike McMullen Thanks John.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.  Jeff Elliott Yes, thanks for the question there. First one for me is on the academic and government in the market. I guess you talked about a spending pause in the U.S. Can you give us a little more color there? I guess when did that happen and what do you see in other geographies in terms of academic and government?   Mike McMullen Patrick, why don’t you take that one. Patrick Kaltenbach Sure, thanks, happy to take it. So as Mike alluded to first, it was tough compared to last year. This is one of the major reasons why it has been flat or slightly negative this quarter. And we had also lower spending in the US, it was softer than we had expected especially in September. For a very specific month we have seen smaller deals and our customers are a little bit more cautious given the budget uncertainties they have seen in some areas. So looking forward we actually [Audio Gap]. Jeff Elliott Got it. And how about other geographies like Japan. I guess what do you see in the academic and government funding their?  Patrick Kaltenbach Well, on a worldwide base I would say is what we have seen is that it was more solid in Europe and in China and Japan it was also flat for the last quarter. So the biggest impact we have seen was definitely in the U.S.  Jeff Elliott Okay, and then one more from me. On the forensics side, you referenced timing of some larger deals I guess. What happened there and can you quantify how big the impact was? Patrick Kaltenbach On forensics?  Jeff Elliott Yes. Patrick Kaltenbach Yes, well the growth for forensic was in the low single digit for the quarter, yes. Which one do you mean it now? Mike McMullen Jeff, would you mind repeating your question so we make sure we got the solid answer for you? Jeff Elliott Yes, just earlier in the prepared remarks I guess in the deck you talked about forensic being muted by the timing of the larger deals. Yes, I’m just kind of curious on what happened in terms of the timing and how big those larger deals were. What was the impact? Patrick Kaltenbach You mean, okay for the deals in the US. Again, last year given we had these double digit growth, it was based on several large deals we had. Those large deals, we haven’t seen the same magnitude this year, this is what I wanted to say. So they were smaller compared to last year. This is also brought the overall growth down in the U.S. Jeff Elliott Okay, thanks guys. Mike McMullen You’re welcome, Jeff. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open. Dane Leone Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike McMullen Sure. Dane Leone I think I’ll stick with the guidance if you wouldn’t mind. Could you maybe breakdown expectations for the three main segments next year? I mean effectively in our models right now we’re essentially having the organic growth rate that you guys reported in 2015. So if you could kind of help us source maybe where we should modify some expectations, I think that would be pretty helpful. Mike McMullen Sure Dane, I’ll be happy to. So as we looked at the growth assumptions by end markets, I think the biggest one I think will be chemical energy, which is as you know 25% of the company and we’re assuming flat for the entire year.  The applied markets low single digit growth, higher for food, but really no growth in the environmental side of that segment and then as Patrick mentioned earlier, government and academia in the low single digits, pharma high single digits and the diagnosis and the clinical markets are also high single digits. So you can see there’s quite a mix between the pharma and diagnostics market of differential versus the chemical energy space. Dane Leone So if we flow that through the model, I think where we might have a little trouble is looking at 2016. So we give about – take everything together about 3% top-line growth to get to that $4.16 billion. To get to the operating profit line of about 20 spot to five or spot two if you wanted the brand, that’s about a 60% plus variable margin, which seems a bit high given you can kind of go back in history, and I think even in kind of coming out of a trough year in 2010 it was still about 55%. And then when we flow that through to 2017 to kind of hit the targets, you are talking about another 60% variable margin.   Can you kind of help us in line with where you guys laid out your analyst day and reiterated in the presentation here, how to get to that 22% operating margin in 2017, because it’s I guess looking pretty aggressive at the moment. Didier Hirsch Yes, I mean there’s a lot of moving parts, but nothing has fundamentally changed, except that we exceeded our first year opening margin expansion goal basically achieving 170 basis points. So we are now one year or three up, 43% of our goal. So we are a little bit ahead of what we had committed to and as stated by Mike, we certainly didn’t want to assume a second fantastic year like this one or at least provide that as a guidance at this place, at this time and decided to have a guidance that is somehow conservative.  But nothing has fundamentally changed, but the moving parts are really I mean like this. I mean the salary increases, I mean all the different components, the new trends to our projections regarding the benefits from the NMR exit, from the Agile Agilent program, from the fact that we have the FDA warning there behind us, the OSS, the order fulfillment annual improvement, there’s really no chance. The only chance I would say is a positive chance we’re slightly ahead of the game at the end of Tier 1. Mike McMullen Yes Dane, if I could just add some additional comments here too. So we’re really quite pleased with how we performed this first year. I think we’re well in that trajectory to 22% and finally we found a way to get there even if we got a little bit lower on the top line revenue.  I also would say that part of our thinking was influenced by many of our major systems infrastructure programs, which I think I’ve talked to you in the past around the Agile Agilent. These are multiyear programs and a lot of them will start hitting into the end of 2016. So we started to get the real big million dollar cost savings coming out of our infrastructure in ’17. So we’re right on our plan, in fact ahead of our internal plan. So we’re quite confident in our ability to get to that 22, but there are some timing issues related to some of our major, major programs.  Dane Leone Thank you very much. Mike McMullen Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve Beuchaw Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Mike, we focused a lot here on the impact of chem and energy. I wonder if we could think about a couple of potential catalyst to the upside; one is NIH budgets. And to what extent are you thinking about the possibility of stronger funding for the NIH and if the NIH gets something like a plus five for 2016, what does that mean for your business? Mike McMullen Yes, let me make some general comments and then if you have anything specific to add onto that, Patrick that would be great. Clearly if the NIH funding would go up, that would be a positive for the business, albeit I think as Patrick will share, it’s not a huge part of the overall funding for our company, but that will be positive news and that’s also as I said earlier, we’ll watch the business for the next quarter or two and kind of see where things go. So if these positive developments happen, it will be reflected in our view of the outlook for the business.  But what we did want to do is plan on a lot of good news now given some of the uncertainty of either budgets being finalized or where some of these end markets and economies are going. And Patrick, I can’t remember the exact percentage of our funding to NIH. So maybe you can add a little color there as well. Patrick Kaltenbach Well, I don’t have the exact funding, but I agree with you that we didn’t bake in numbers like the ones have just been mentioned, certainly not the 5% they are going at low single digit projections on the budgets. So if there is upside, we’ll be happy to take it.  Mike McMullen Absolutely, absolutely. Steve Beuchaw Okay, thanks for that. And then just one for Jacob. I'm sorry, if you wouldn’t mind, could you give just us a bit more granularity on the performance of Dako in the quarter. I’m not sure if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but did you give a growth rate and any additional color on the driver and dynamics, whether they are competitive or otherwise really appreciative? Thanks so much. Jacob Thaysen Hey Steve, as you know we don’t provide insight on the individual divisions, but I can say that we continue to see strong performance in our pathology business and this continues to break records in placements and that obviously is driving the growth there. So we see great growth there in our companion diagnostic business, with all the activities around the recent launches within the PDL-1, it’s also a great growth driver. So overall I see great momentum in the businesses, but the actual number I cannot comment on. Steve Beuchaw Got it, thanks so much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Tim Evans Hi, thank you. I wanted to drill down on the pharma and biotech end markets a little bit, and the strongest growth for you this year last year and it sounds like next year that expectation is that it would continue to be your strongest grower. Can you talk about some of the technologies that you are seeing being the strongest drivers of that growth and how you are addressing that market and also I'd like to hear about whether this is big pharma, is it small midsize pharma, is a contract labs, what kind of clients are you seeing driving the growth? Thanks. Mike McMullen Why don’t you take that one Patrick and I’ll have a follow-up. Patrick Kaltenbach Yes, so these are several questions at once. So let me start with the platforms that drive the growth. Actually we had very competitive platforms for the pharmaceutical and the biopharmaceutical markets. The biggest growth driver right comes actually out of the LC business, which drives a lot of replacement business off the installed basis.  You probably know we had more than [140,000 1,100] [ph] systems installed worldwide. A lot of them are in the pharma space and the offering we have today with the Infinity II series gives a seamless replacement of the systems which have a much higher performance, better efficiency, so a huge improvement from our customers. So that resonates well and it resonates actually well across the board, whether its smaller pharma or large pharma. The large deals of course come mainly out of the large pharmas and we have seen several big deals in the U.S., as well as in Europe in the last quarter. The second piece of the question was regarding biopharma. In biopharma we see actually higher growth moving forward than in small molecule pharma and we continue to address this also with more specific solutions around our LCMS portfolio and some of it also in the spectroscopy space.  So I think we have a very attractive portfolio for our customers. We have a lot of good new releases. This year out with the 6470 Triple-Quad system which is well received from pharma as well and they will continue to drive growth for us in this space. Mike McMullen And Patrick, if I can just add one final comment here. Tim, your focused on the technologies driving a lot of the growth in our reported pharma results, but also call your attention to the Agilent CrossLab group who delivered another double digit growth in the fourth quarter and we’re seeing strong demand for our services in consumables CrossLab services and consumables in the pharma as well as our technology offerings. Tim Evans Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.  Tycho Peterson Maybe just to follow-up on the pharma. I mean you guys have been trending along the 6% to 8% growth, but the 19% growth really stands out. Was there anything one-time that you saw this quarter on the pharma business that you can call on? Mike McMullen Tycho you broke up a bit. I think what you asked was we had put up double digit growth and was anything of a one-time nature in this most recent quarter. I just want to make sure I understand the question. Tycho Peterson Yes, I mean you have been kind of growing pharma 6% to 8%, so 19% was certainly notable. So was there anything you can call out that was unique to the quarter? Mike McMullen No, we had several quarters in a row where we had double digit growth in pharma, so it’s really and as Mike said, moving forward we see it continue to grow into high single digits at least. Tycho Peterson Okay, and then for Didier, I’m just trying to understand the explanation on the free cash flow down 20% in six months relative to what you said at the end of May, currency hasn’t really moved. So I’m just trying to understand the explanation there. A - Didier Hirsch  So since in May we provided the number at the Analyst and Investor Day, just taking away all the one-time cash outflows that we had during the year, which are related to the separations deal where we had to pay a lot of invoices related to the separation and also, I think about $50 million of taxes that were related to the separation also.  So my point was just the number that we have now is even better, because it is the number that includes those elements, even better than the 555 that we provided that excluded those elements. So we have a better operating cash flow than we projected in May, however it is not as good as the one as we projected back in November of the previous year and mostly related to currency. Tycho Peterson Okay, and then last one just capital deployment. You highlighted Seahorse and Cartagenia, should we assume deals of similar magnitude going forward or do you have an appetite to potentially do something a little bit larger? Mike McMullen Yes, we’ve talked about it at the Analyst and Investor Day of potentially two deals of the size of Seahorse per annum. Obviously it could be slightly bigger, but we were not looking at any larger deals in the short term, but we are ready to take on the two deals of that size per year perhaps, slightly bigger. Tycho Peterson Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik de Bruin Hi, good afternoon. Mike McMullen Good afternoon Derik. Derik de Bruin So a couple of questions. First of all, could you talk about the academic? I'm a little bit surprised just given that some of your competitors like Sterno have a much bigger academic exposure, basically didn't call it anything unusual in September. So could you talk a little bit more about that and particularly what did you see in October since you guys got a little bit longer. Patrick Kaltenbach No, I’ll take that again. Again the compare for us this quarter was mainly a difficult compare, because we had a strong Q4 last year with double digit growth with some exceptional large deals in this space. The pause or the slowdown we have seen in September, where they usually have low budget release to some extent came back in October, so we’ve seen for the year and we are on track with what we project in the low to mid single digit growth rate for academia and government. Derik de Bruin Right, I think it’s obviously not a time to turn into revenue, yes. Patrick Kaltenbach Yes. Derik de Bruin Got you, but I just wanted the clarity, thank you. And could you give a little bit more color. I mean your 4.25% core growth, what are you sort of looking for core growth in each of the segment; LS, DX, at CrossLab?   Mike McMullen So yes, we are not providing the projections per segment, however I will tell you and that won’t surprise you that our instrument segment LSAG will have slightly lower than the average and our other two segments Agilent CrossLab and DGG will have higher growth rate than the average. Derik de Bruin Great, I’ll get back in the queue, thanks. Mike McMullen Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan Hi, thanks, and good afternoon. I just wanted to ask, could you talk about the level of visibility in the budgets and chemical and energy end market and just do you feel like things have begun to bottom out now after a few quarters in the exploration business? Mike McMullen Derek, why don’t you take that one. Didier Hirsch I can take this, yes. So you’re actually right. We see currently marketing really bottoming out, so we don’t expect any major further declines on the exploration side, which gives us confidence that the growth rate that Mike projected and being in the low single digits combined chemical energy should also materialize moving forward. We are now like four to five quarters in this situation with the low oil price and we had been mainly hit in the first couple of quarters on the exploration side and now we see this really bottoming out. Mike McMullen Yes, this is a point of clarification, we are forecasting flat for right now. Jack Meehan Got it, that’s helpful. And then just one more on the deal environment, just curious if you had any updated thoughts on the cash that your holding overseas. Thanks. Didier Hirsch Yes, I mean we have about $200 million of cash we had at the end of October in the U.S., plus $235 million in escrow for the Seahorse, which was put to good use on November 1. The rest of the cash is overseas. We’ve had a good year in terms of being able to repatriate some of that overseas cash into the U.S., that’s why we ended there with $435 million about and we are looking for continued support to bring back some of the cash tax effectively, but you feel most of the cash that we generate is overseas. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brandon Couillard Thanks. Good evening. Most of my questions have been addressed already, but Mike, just one for you on the decision to expand the capacity of the nucleic acid solutions business. You clearly speak to the drivers of that decision and exactly where capacity utilization is today and what the, I guess P&L effects in terms of growth, the implications are in 2017, around that. Mike McMullen Brandon, thanks. I’d love to take that call. It’s a great story and I think I’ll allow Jacob the pleasure of responding to that one. Jacob Thaysen Yes, thank you. So as you know our nuclear gases solution division is manufacturing oligos for active pharmaceutical ingredients and we have seen a significant demand for those products over the last few years and we continue to see demand that actually is beyond our current capacity, and therefore we’ve decided to invest in expanding that capacity over the next few years and this is actually what has been reflected in that buy. This activity will set in the DGG business. Mike McMullen Brandon, this is Mike again. The beauty of this business is we will get long term customer commitments for purchase volumes and then you’ll start to see this show up in a very significant amount of revenue as you get in the outer years like ’17 and ’18 for the company. Brandon Couillard That’s helpful, and then Didier, just one clarification. Did you say that you’ve embedded the mid to high single-digit growth outcome for China for ’16, was that right?  Didier Hirsch Yes, I think its Michael who made the comment. Mike McMullen I think that was me. I said we were expecting mid single digit growth in China and what could happen Brandon, kind of what happened in the chemical and energy, we could see that get to high single digit growth as an overall market. Just some additional color here. We expect the pharma, the food and environmental segments to continue to be quite strong as an end market, along with continued interest in the services and consumables. Again the wildcard that will lure us between the two estimate points would be what growth rate we would see in the chemical and energy space, but it looks like a solid growth market for us year and then again what happens to chemical and energy, we could see more end market growth than what we are projecting now.  Brandon Couillard Super. Thank you. Mike McMullen Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open. Miroslava Minkova Hi, good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on this last comment here. On China and the chemical and energy business, have you seen that deteriorate further or how are the orders tracking in that business given the macro headwinds coming out of China? Mike McMullen Yes Miro, this is Mike, thanks for the question. Although we don’t specifically comment on orders, what I can just refer you to is your overall view of the results for the quarter in a revenue standpoint and its four quarters in a row are flat. I believe earlier Patrick used the comments that we think we bottomed out and I think that applies to China as well. Miroslava Minkova Sounds good, thank you for that comment. Secondly, just given the sort of mixed end market environment for you. Wondering how are you prioritizing your investments for fiscal ‘16? Has anything changed in terms of your thinking there as well as the level of investment you devote to each of the end markets? Mike McMullen Great question, and I think as you know we try to align our investments to where we see the best growth prospects. But I have to say that the market has been fairly consistent in terms of how it’s developed relative to our internal view of where to place our bets and I’d say no. I don’t think there’s any really fundamental changes to our investments and technology front or in places where we are building out our channel coverage.  Miroslava Minkova Okay, sounds good. And lastly, for Didier, the negative 1.7% of currency you see next year, what kind of flow-through should we assume on EPS? Didier Hirsch Similar to what we have seen in 2015, so about 20%. We think that currency will have an impact of about $68 million for the year and the impact on the operating profit is about 14, 15.  Miroslava Minkova Okay, great. Thank you guys.  Didier Hirsch Welcome.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Doug Schenkel Hey, good afternoon guys.  A - Mike McMullen  Good afternoon Dough.  Doug Schenkel So based on what I am hearing from a lot of folks who are listening to this call, I think there is a little bit of a debate as to how to view your guidance. I think that’s a clear observation at this point.  So Mike, you acknowledge previously that you maybe should have guided ‘15 to maybe slightly more conservative levels and now we have fiscal ‘16 guidance and like I just said I think a lot of folks are trying to figure out how much of this guide is you swinging to the other extreme, which seems pretty prudent for a variety of reasons, including the macro backdrop or is there something fundamental you are seeing as giving your reason for a pause. So if I could just, as we are kind of getting into the end of this call, take another shot at asking a couple of questions?   The first would be your guidance implies that margin will expand, operating margin will expand by 50 to 100 basis points this year and then 150 to 200 basis points in fiscal ‘17, if I’m doing the math right. How much is that dependent on a favorable changes in revenue mix relative to recent trends?  The second question would be recognizing a key focus area for you Mike has been to bring much of what you successfully did with Chemical Analysis to broader Agilent. Is the variable cost structure progressing to the point where you still feel comfortable that you can get to that 22% margin target in fiscal ’17, even if core revenue growth is, say, 4% to 4.5% the next couple of years.  The third question would be getting at really the question of fundamental demand and recognizing you don’t want to get into book-to-bill’s for the reasons that your outlined previously. To be fair, a lot of your peers do comment at least on demand coming out of the quarter, heading into the end of the quarter. Given the performance and LSAG it seems like it would be helpful for you guys to at least say something about trends there.  And the last one would be, Tycho asked a question about free cash flow guidance for fiscal ’16. To be more specific, at your Analyst Day you guided us to expect $620 million in free cash flow this year. Your guidance is now for $510 million. So FX has changed, but really only a little bit and I know there a lot of one timers in there. But a $110 million is a big delta. Can you just walk us through what’s going on there? Thank you. Mike McMullen Sure Dough, these are very important questions. So I appreciate the opportunity to add some additional clarity. So if I miss anything please come back to me, but I think I’ve got the key points here. One is, let’s start with the view of 22%, how depended it is on a higher level of revenue.  As I may have indicated earlier in a call its 4%, 4.5%, we will make the 22% operating profit in 2017. And I say that with a lot of confidence, because of the results we have put up over the last three quarters, plus I know we have a number of major programs that we have to deliver on their projected cost savings. You start to see those near the tail-end of ’16 going into ’17. They are completely independent of revenue.  We are assuming no significant change of revenue mix beyond what we have shared at the Analyst Day and also what you saw in the results. We do expect our ACG and DGG Groups to grow faster than LSAG, but LSAG will also grow. We do expect our non-instrument product lines to grow faster.  And in terms of the commentary, we saw no real change in fundamental demand coming through and existing the quarter. The comments we made about revenue I think speak directly to how we saw the quarter develop, and again back to how you made it all off a question. I mean part of it is a reflection on 2015 guidance and also the fact that we do want to be prudent out the gate and a little bit more conservative. It’s still early in the year, and there are couple of things that are trying to handicap in terms of what’s going on with chemical and energy, how will the emerging markets hold up in some of the economic concerns they have.  But I would not at all take this as a lack of confidence in the business going forward or any kind of significant last quarter changes. In fact we are really, really pleased with the way the year closed, the numbers we put up and how they closed off our first year.  So Didier, I’m going to let you handle the last questing of the bridge between the free cash flow of 620 to... Didier Hirsch  Well, so in the past I had talked about 2015 and the fact that we ended about high free cash flow that what I had motioned at the time, and the reason why you don’t – I mean we are not comparing apple-to-apple is just because of the one-time expenses. So if you want doing the follow-up calls and I will do that with each of you. We can go over the one-time items and the impact those have. That’s probably the best to do.  Doug Schenkel Okay. Thanks guys for taking all the questions.  Mike McMullen No problem Dough. I appreciate the opportunity to answer them.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Dan Arias Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe just two quick ones for me on NMR. Mike, how removed are you at this point from that business, and from the servicing of your customers there and then Didier, can you just touch on what you are assuming for operating profit improvement in 2016 for NMR?  Mike McMullen Sure, relative to NMR, as you know we excited the NMR hardware business but have maintained the service relationship and that continues to go very well in terms of our ability to service and support our customers and it’s really a major part of our thinking when we closed down the hardware business. But we really wanted to preserve and mitigate the impact of our customers. So we are in a position to be able to handle their long term service needs. And Didier, I think you’ve got some specifics on the expectations for next year.  Didier Hirsch Yes, there is no change to the guidance that we have provided. We had about $15 million of cost reductions and expense reduction in fiscal year ’15. Next year we anticipate an additional $5 million, in line with what we had previously stated.  Dan Arias And I think you guided Didier some revenue flow through as we work-off the last part of the backlog in ’16. So there will still be some.  Didier Hirsch Should be $12 million still revenues in 2016.  Dan Arias Okay, thanks very much.  Mike McMullen You’re welcome.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open.  Paul Knight Hi Mike. Only a couple of bricks to move now.  Mike McMullen Thanks Paul. Paul Knight Geographically, I know you talked about China, where is your thought on Europe and the United States in ’16? Mike McMullen Thanks Paul. I appreciate the opportunity to answer. Great, great question. So we see the U.S. as a real area of strength, albeit some of the commentary around what may happen in terms of the chemical energy space and how its impacting the U.S. business. So we see the market there being very robust and was a source of strength for the company for the quarter and for the year. So we are looking forward to continued strength in the U.S.  And I think the same call in Europe and Europe holds as well. I think part of our European business the report has been – it includes some of the Middle East and Eastern European courtiers and would have been a little bit of a challenge for us, particularly in the chemical and energy space. But overall Western Europe and Germany in particular has been extremely strong for us and we are seeing no indication of that is changing for us in our European based business.  Paul Knight And then lastly when you look at the energy sector, I know there is a lot of pieces like gas Chromatography and Spectroscopy on the metals mining side, but weren’t you already seeing that market pretty soft in the earlier quarters of this fiscal year Mike and I guess the short question is it’s been weak already, has it not? Mike McMullen Yes, that’s correct Paul and you hit the right categories where it really affects our gas Chromatography business where we have such a strong position in that segment. I think that was one of the mix issues that Patrick had alluded to earlier. And then in the metals and mining, that’s where we really have seen a slowdown as it relates to our Spectroscopy business.  So you might look at say in 2016 that we could see some reported revenues versus easy compares, but we’ll wait till we call it in. But again, we think that it looks like to us that the market may have bottoms and that perhaps the worst is behind us.   Paul Knight Right, you have been through a few cycles yourself running that division. I mean what does the market feel like? You sense the bottom in some of these categories? Mike McMullen Yes, I mean we think so. I mean customers are starting to talk about the new technologies and replacement, particularly as it relates to data systems and associated systems. Some of the customers are still fairly conservative. You know BASF was out with a downgrade in term of their outlook for ’16. But at the same point in time, the equipment is required to keep their facilities running at the highest levels of operational efficiency, so there is an active funnel. So we now are seeing to start closing some business.  Paul Knight Okay. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Your line is now open. Dan Leonard Thank you; two quick ones. One Didier, is there anything you would like to call out on the quarterly cadence in 2016 as we consider our models. I mean presumably Q3 is going to be a very difficult comparison.  And then secondly for Jacob, is there any effort or plan to migrate a couple of these companion diagnostic approval to the ominous system. I looked like they were approved on your older Autostainer. Thank you.  Didier Hirsch So on the first question, Dan we will have the usual higher operating margin in the second half than in the first half based on volume and also because on the actions that we are taking throughout the year, which will have a more of an impact in terms of cost and expense reduction, already in the second half because of the carry over impact. So you should see a fairly steady ramp in operating margin throughout the year, very much in line with the usual seasonality and the pattern. Mike McMullen One Didier, one additional thought here might be looking at Q2, Q3 revenue year-over-year and that we had some logistical start up issues in our Q2 where we have some track revenue. Didier Hirsch But basically we are forecasting higher operating margins throughout the year.  Mike McMullen Okay, got it.  Patrick Kaltenbach Hey Dan, let me address the other question also. So you asked about the right that we developed the PD-L1 for the Autostainers right now, and the reason is that these activates is ongoing for many years also, so we start off with the Autostainers packing base, where we also have the highest installed base. But your absolutely right that we are actively also moving it over to the Ominous and will clear have our full portfolio on the Ominous going forward, including our companion diagnostics, so that will happen.  Dan Leonard Got it. Thank you. Mike McMullen Thanks Dan. Operator Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks.  Alicia Rodriguez  Thank you Sabrina and on behalf of the management team, I’d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to give us call on IR and I’d like to end by wishing everybody a good day. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today’s call. I will start with a summary of our Q3 performance. Then I’ll move to an update and outlook on operating margin expansion and capital deployment plans. Finally, I will close with our full-year guidance. I am very pleased to report our Q3 results, with the Agilent team delivering revenue at the high-end of our guidance and earnings above our guidance range. Agilent’s Q3 revenue of $1.01 billion grew 1% over a year ago, up 9% on a core basis. Orders of $953 million, while down 6% compared to a year ago, were up 3% on a core basis.  Our strong revenue growth was driven by continued strength in the pharma, diagnostics, environmental and forensics markets, and across all geographies. We saw strong customer acceptance of our new instrument product introductions, and strength in our CrossLab services and consumables, diagnostics and genomics offerings. We also resolved previous start-up issues in our Americas Logistics Center, which delayed $15 million of shipments last quarter. A few additional comments on the order front, our 3% core growth was against a tough compare of 9% growth in Q3 ’14. We also experienced some U.S. and state government big deal delays into Q4, and customers in the industrial markets continue to take a cautious stance, in like a weak -- in light of weak commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economies. Adjusted operating margin, including the adjustment for Keysight billings, was 19.9%, expanding 110 basis points over a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.44. This marks another quarter of significant year-over-year margin improvements, driven by our intense focus on growing our operating margin, as we seek to achieve 22% margins by fiscal 2017. Moving on to the results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group or LSAG as a reminder, brings together Agilent’s analytical laboratory instruments and informatics. Core revenue growth of 9% was driven by strong performance in Pharma, environmental and forensics markets. Core orders were down 1%. LSAG operating margin for the quarter was 18.7%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. The previously announced exit of the NMR hardware business continues to proceed as planned. We expect our LSAG sales funnels to continue to strengthen, given a number of recent significant new product introductions. At June’s HPLC 2015 Conference in Geneva, we further enhanced our new Infinity II LC line with the new 1290 Infinity II Vial-Sampler. This product significantly lowers the entry price to the top-line product range, offering analytical laboratories a cost-effective way to experience the advantages of ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography. We released the 6470 LC/MS Triple-Quad at ASMS in June. This newly engineered core platform provides attogram-level sensitivity, and accurate quantitation with up to six orders of linear dynamic range. The new product delivers significant improvements to the best-selling core LC/MS Triple-Quad, the 6460. It offers improved performance, precision, speed and robustness; and features a small footprint to preserve bench space in the lab. And in spectroscopy, the 7800 quadrupole ICP-MS, which we launched in Q2, is the latest addition to Agilent’s industry-leading ICP-MS portfolio. This new product raises the standard for routine elemental analysis. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group, or ACG, combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables businesses under a new Agilent brand. Core revenues were up 8%, while core orders grew 6% in the quarter. Operating margin was 22.6%. Last quarter, we launched the Agilent CrossLab Brand Promise program. This program is focused on delivering a new and integrated approach that offers actionable insights to help customers. New service solutions include laboratory business intelligence reporting, RFID inventory management services, and laboratory asset utilization services. And in consumables, we expanded our AdvanceBio portfolio of solutions, which enables scientists to speed research and lower costs. Finally, turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, DGG is comprised of three divisions: the former Dako business, Genomics and Nucleic Acid Solutions. DGG’s results were driven by excellent performance across all three divisions, pathology and companion diagnostics, genomics and nucleic acid businesses.  DGG’s core revenue grew 10% versus a year ago. Orders grew 8% on a core basis. Operating margin of 16.8% was up 330 basis points over Q3 of fiscal year 2014. In the third quarter, DGG completed its acquisition of Cartagenia, a leading provider of software for clinical genetics and molecular pathology labs. We launched updated Gene Expression Microarray tools for researchers to better investigate expression patterns on a highly accessible platform. Adding to products for next generation sequencing, we released new Target-Enrichment Solutions for disease research, which will address current limitations in exome sequencing. Now, let’s take a brief look at Agilent’s revenue by end market performance on a core basis. Life sciences and diagnostics markets continued to see strength in pharma, a recovery with strong demand in the diagnostics and clinical market, and moderate growth in academia and government. Applied end-market performance was led by continued spending in environmental and forensics, and moderate growth in food. Chemical and energy was flat, due to reduced investments in oil exploration. We also saw cautious spending in downstream refining and chemical segments, driven by macroeconomic uncertainty concerns. Geographically, we saw healthy core revenue growth across all regions, particularly in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, with strong growth in China. Major pharma spending was brisk, with large firms upgrading to the new Infinity LC platform. Turning from the report out of Agilent’s revenue and order results, let me update you on our operating margin improvement initiatives and Q3 capital deployment actions and outlook. Thanks to those of you on the call who joined us at our May Analyst and Investor Meeting. As a reminder, I highlighted three focus areas where we are working as a team to drive shareholder value: deliver above-market revenue growth, expand operating margins to historic highs and return 85% of free cash flow to shareholders. I’ve just discussed our revenue growth. Now here’s an update on our operating margin and capital deployment. Our multi-year “Agile Agilent” program is re-engineering the company to be more efficient, nimble and externally focused. As of the third fiscal quarter, we have delivered $35 million of the expected gross savings of $50 million in 2015 from our combined actions. We are committed to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY ‘17, a three point improvement over FY ‘14, while continuing to invest for long-term revenue growth. With the margin improvement results over the past two quarters, we are very confident in our ability to deliver on our margin expansion goals. Now turning to capital deployment. As previously guided, we are on track to return $500 million this year to shareholders in the form of dividends and buy backs. In Q3, we repurchased $99 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $267 million. With respect to guidance, we are reaffirming our previous FY 2015 EPS guidance of $1.68 to $1.72, as the operating model of the new Agilent continues to drive profitable growth and margin expansion. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional details on our guidance and financial results. Didier? Didier Hirsch Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, our core order and revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures were respectively 3% and 9%. This quarter, currency subtracted 6.9 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth. And as Mike stated, start-up issues with the transfer of U.S. distribution center were resolved in Q3, which resulted in about $15 million of additional revenue. Finally, adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, 160 basis points higher than our guidance and 110 basis points higher than last year on just 0.5% higher nominal revenues. Excluding the $40 million annual cost dis-synergies resulting from the Agilent/Keysight split, operating margin grew 210 basis points.  I will now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.49. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.7% on a core basis and our 20.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 40 basis points sequentially. We expect to continue our disciplined buyback program with planned purchases of $98 million in Q4. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2015. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.6% on a core basis, again, excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures. Fiscal year '15 revenue guidance is $37 million lower than previous guidance, of which $15 million is due to currency. Our EPS guidance of $1.70 at midpoint is unchanged from previous guidance, due to additional Agile Agilent savings that compensated for slightly lower revenues. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 19.2% or 40 basis points higher than last year. Excluding the impact of the $40 million cost dis-synergies related to the Agilent/Keysight split, our operating margin will be 140 basis points over previous year, on flat reported revenue growth. With that, I will turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A Alicia Rodriguez Thank you, Didier. Abigail, would you please give the instructions for the Q&A. <p id="question-answer-session" class="p p4">Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is open. Dan Leonard Thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your book-to-bill. I think I’m calculating a 0.94, which is the lowest you’ve had in years. So I wonder if there's any additional color to be offered there. Mike McMullen Yes. I’m looking at Didier in the conference room here. I think that number is correct. And we had very, very strong Q3 revenue. And as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to have our growth rate pick up as we have -- are expecting a number of areas of strength in the marketplace, such as pharma, the diagnostics, the environmental forensic space that I talked about earlier continue to be quite strong. And we've had a lot of new product introductions. Our sales funnels are building. And we’ve seen really strong win loss ratios of that new business. And sometimes orders can be a little bit lumpy. So we do see some big deals moving between quarters, which we saw here in the third quarter on the state and federal level in United States. And I would just also point out we had a tough compare when we look at kind of the results for the third quarter. Dan Leonard Got it. So nothing you had specifically spike out as an area of concern then? Mike McMullen No absolutely, not. I think we have a lot of reasons to be positive about the outlook. And other thing I did not mention, Dan, was that, we got off to a slow start in the third quarter in incoming orders after finishing so strong in Q2. But throughout the quarter, we saw an acceleration of incoming orders throughout the quarter and finished the quarter strong. Dan Leonard Got it. Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard Hi. Good afternoon. Mike, would be interested in getting some more granularity on just how China performed in the period, how the book-to-bill ended there? And what you perceive the implications of the currency revaluation are to your profitability there? And just remind us whether you price in local currency or in USD? Mike McMullen Yes. Sure. I mean, great question. I figure we'd probably spend some time today talking about China, given some of the recent news. But in terms of our performance in China in the third quarter, we have very strong revenue growth with low-double digits. And we’re tracking through the first three quarters right on the plans. We've talked about with all of you at the analyst meeting the high-single digit level of growth in China.  In terms of the areas of strength, we’re continuing to see strength in pharma, life science, research, the diagnostics, food, environmental. And the business really continues to develop as we had expected, albeit some of the recent changes, which in terms of how that affects our profitability in China, it's really neutral. We’re naturally hedged in China in terms of both the amount of revenues that we bring in, in China. Even though it is our second largest country in terms of revenue, we also have a very large footprint there, including local manufacturing. So we are naturally hedged in China. And in terms of your question around the mix of RMB versus dollars, about 20% of our business is in RMB and about 80% is in dollars. And in terms of the overall business, just maybe one final comment here on China, we can dig into other areas of China if you like. But when we look at the devaluation, we’re not really expecting to have that significant of an impact on the business in China itself. And then it depends also how you view to actually be successful and drive some more growth there. I think the better question is, what could it mean to the economies and currency in some of the emerging markets? But hopefully I answered your question. If not, come back with another one. Brandon Couillard Yes. That’s helpful. And then just one question on the chemical and energy markets. Could you give us any color around what the order trends are like there and whether you’re seeing any signs of stability I guess in the sort of energy-related end market if at all? Mike McMullen Yes. Great question. So we have seen stability, although it’s not where we hope to see coming into this year. So we’re now three quarters in a row of basically flat business in chemical and energy. And I think it's no surprise that the exploration side of that business is down fairly significantly. And we had anticipated that. And just to remind you of an exploration side, our business account for about 15% of this total segment. We are seeing growth in the downstream, chemical and refining process but not to degree that we had hoped to see early this year. So basically we get -- it’s grown enough to offset the downward pressure on the exploration side. Again that segment of the market is very profitable, but they seem to be still cautious on their spending. As you may recall from the analyst meeting we talked to you about our view that this was a 2% to 4% market growth segment and we still see it that way, but we’re just being cautious in our Q4 outlook in this segment right now. We do think it’s stabilizing. We got three quarters in a row of basically flat business in this segment for us. Brandon Couillard Super. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel Hi. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the questions. Mike McMullen Hi, Doug. Doug Schenkel So I guess I want to go back to Dan's question. I mean, it was a pretty solid quarter, but again that book-to-bill of 0.94 was arguably notably light. And the revenue number while solid, it wasn't Herculean feat. So it is helpful to hear the commentary on momentum building over the course of the quarter. That said, even recognizing the commentary in the slight reduction to guidance, the Q4 bar is still pretty high. You did lower guidance, albeit by only about $20 million, excluding FX. You could have chosen to cut more. Is it fair to say that if you saw any change in ordering patterns in the early part of this quarter, in particular those attributable -- now basically those customers that are more exposed to macroeconomic concerns that you probably would have cut guidance more? Mike McMullen Yes, Doug. Thanks for the question. And if I may humbly disagree in terms of the comments that revenue actually were quite pleased with being able to put those types of revenue numbers. But I think you’re on the right path. And question here, which is 3% constant currency order growth, what kind of converse do we have going forward? Clearly, if we have seen some of those patterns, I mean we’re having that call here today. We would reflect it in our guidance.  And we have reason to be positive about the outlook. If you look at the business by our three groups, our ACG and DGG business have momentum. It’s a recurring revenue business. That business is tracking very nicely. We talked to you about -- I am actually going to ask Patrick to jump in and provide his perspective and as well. I think the obvious question is what’s the outlook for LSAG? And I think we’re one of the few companies out in the space that reports orders. So I think sometimes they get caught in these stories of lumpiness between quarters. When we look at our business here, we respect pharma, biopharma, diagnostics, clinical diagnostics, environment space to remain strong. China is on a steady trajectory, no expected hiccups there. And we just had a number of new product introductions and we’re coming off with tough year, yearly compare and a really strong Q2. So Patrick, I don’t know if you have anything else you would like to add to my comments? Patrick Kaltenbach Sure, Mike. Thanks. Yes, of course I kind of want to restate that you said here we had. In terms of your order pattern, order for LSAG, we had a slower start based on the very, very strong Q2. We had an also tough compare against last year where several of our big platforms have been 20% plus growth. Having said that, the pattern over Q3 was definitely accelerating through -- positively accelerating through Q3. And as you stated, the outlook for Q4 is positive. We see strong positive momentum in pharma where we have seen strong double-digit growth and we have no belief that momentum will slow down over the next couple of quarters. So given the confidence in our new platforms, which have been very well received, LCMS, and also latest introduction on the ICP-MS front, we are confident that we can deliver more plan for Q4. Doug Schenkel Okay. Thanks, Mike and Patrick. That’s all real helpful. And one quick follow-up. I apologize if I missed this. The $30 million in revenue delayed from Q2 and the Q3 or at least that you talked about on the Q2 call, does that fully come through this quarter or will some of that potentially come through in Q4? Mike McMullen Didier has been quite today, so I think I will pass the call to have… Didier Hirsch Yes. Back in Q2, we talked about the $30 million of being two parts. One part is the $15 million that was a clear miss from the change in the logistic center and we recovered that fully into Q3. The second part is about more of the new normal. What it means is that we have orders coming in later in the quarter and shipment terms being slightly extended versus what we’re used to. And this is really the new normal. So there was no recovery of that second $15 million and we don’t expect it to either to -- I mean, we expect the new normal to be with us for quite sometime. Doug Schenkel Okay. Thanks, guys. Mike McMullen Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson Hey. Thanks. I understand the forward looking commentary here, but I just, think about the quarter on LSAG? Can you actually talk about what drove the 1% decline in core order growth? Where were you most surprise, I guess, relative to your own expectations? Mike McMullen Thanks, Tycho. This is Mike. I am going to make a few comments and then, Patrick, I think, the question was the 1% order growth, where were the areas that we might have been surprise on. What I will do is, I will lead off and actually the order results for the quarter matched our own internal forecast. So we're really weren’t surprised, business developed as we had anticipated. And I think, maybe just kind of emphasizing a few comments would be, we saw some deal push-outs on the U.S. and state governments side, saw some continued flat levels of growth in the Chemical and Energy space. But just few other comments you like to add there, Patrick?  Patrick Kaltenbach Sure, Mike. And the biggest surprise certainly for us was in the U.S. as you said, because we have seen the impact of both on the oil and chemistry side and a couple of delayed orders. On the positive side, Europe held up very nicely, as well as China was strong in growth. So in terms of platform to platform that have been affected most by the large delays, for example, LCMS, which had very tough compare compared to last year, where we had as we said plus 20% growth… Mike McMullen Yeah. I think it was 20% like last year. Patrick Kaltenbach Yeah. Tycho Peterson And then, on DGG, 8% core growth is kind of at the high-end where you’ve talked about for market growth? Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of trends and whether there is a little bit of catch up effect here now around the [omnesys] [ph]. Patrick Kaltenbach Yeah. You are right, I mean, if you look into, I mean, that’s why we have seen a very nice quarter here also with great growth and now see orders coming in at 8%. I do believe that we are on a good traction right now. We are continued to see great performance from the DGG. But you're also right that it did little bit above what I’ve guided in our Analyst Day and clearly, we are also moving through a few quarters here, where we last year had some back order issues in the pathology business there, somewhat is an easy compare, but underlying the momentum is definitely here. Mike McMullen Yeah. I see. Patrick had some tough compares. You have some easy compares coming. Patrick Kaltenbach Right. Right. Tycho Peterson Okay. Thank you. Mike McMullen Thanks, Tycho. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Paul Knight Good afternoon. How are you guys? Mike McMullen Going just well. Didier Hirsch Thanks Paul. Paul Knight Good. On the DGG Group, are the CMS guidelines that were released late in the year, so you where, I guess, implying is it, are those new guidelines helping DGG business and is it kind of more momentum from that occurring right now within that group? Mike McMullen For DGG, what is the, can you clarify MM for me at least? Paul Knight Oh! I am sorry, on the center for Medicare or Medicaid services. They put out the new rules in October last year? Mike McMullen Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. So, why don’t you go over that, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen Yeah. Thanks for that question. Actually, those rules are not really covering the -- our particularly business -- the pathology business and that sits outside the pathology business, so we don’t -- we didn't see any change to that and overall the pathology market continues to be healthy. So we have not been impacted by those changes in guidelines and I don't expect that we will see any changes in our performance due to those guidelines going forward either. Paul Knight Do you think you are taking share in pathology? Jacob Thaysen Yes. I mean, we are -- we definitely continue to see that the on this momentum installation is improving. As I have also mentioned earlier, there is sales cycle that are more than few months or maybe even few quarters. So we are still building momentum, but we continue seeing and also an improvement in taking back market share and win competitive accounts. So I am pretty optimistic around that the future also in pathology business. Paul Knight And then lastly, Mike, on the NMR closure, are you now in the peak of cost savings there or is it part of the reason you're seeing improving margins going forward? Mike McMullen Yeah. We are well above our run rate of cost savings, I would say, we say that initially we were actually for $50 million per year now it’s a $20 million and we are getting to pretty much our run rate there. The one thing I will signal is that, we are -- next year we still we will have about $11 million of revenue that will show on the RPD front and for the first three quarters as we make the last installations and then recognize revenue, so that will be about $50 million reduction from this year and but we will continue showing our orders and revenue on a core basis, excluding NMR so that we are comparing apple-to-apple.  Paul Knight Okay. Thank you. Didier Hirsch Thanks Paul. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. Just want to circle back to an earlier topic in the Q&A, specifically regarding the impact of new products this year in the business? Could you maybe offer like a full-year expectation for contribution from new products to topline? Didier Hirsch How if I pass it over to Patrick and talk about some of the new offerings in the instruments side and Jacob and Mark you comment on your groups and then I will close with answer to your question, Isaac. Patrick Kaltenbach Definitely last few years, so this is Patrick speaking. So when you look at our new product offering this year and there is a series new products we launched, let me start with the LC business where the, actually, end of last year, startup of the Infinity II LC launch and we added this year actually at the HPLC Meeting another set of products to it that is driving definitely a lot of market share gains for us so far this year. In Q3 we had growth in orders and in revenues. We had double-digit growth on this platform driven by strong acceptance in many markets, mainly in the pharmaceutical markets where we see larger enterprises, as well as more companies making replacement and buy some new instruments, because this has -- platform has such a strong offering. Then on LC/MS we just launched the new 6470 Triple Quad system which will overtime replace our very solid performing 6460 Quad platform, again very strong interest after ASMS introduction and there is more to come during the year. So the contribution for product we don’t disclose the actual percentage, but it drives a lot of new business for us and a lot of attention in the market. Mike McMullen And maybe I want to comment on some of the spectroscopy, I know it’s… Patrick Kaltenbach Yes. Yeah. I will just give you an example from the spectroscopy, thanks Mike. So we launched the ICP-MS solution 7800 and on the OES side as we introduced a year ago the IC -- 5100 ICP-OES system that just an example of how we kept about 7 points in market share over 15 months based on this highly differentiated platform. So it’s really one of the means for us to capture market share and drive growth. It will make significant contribution. Mike McMullen I think, Mark, I made a few comments in the call script about some of the recent offerings, but maybe just a few highlights for Isaac on the ACG side. Mark Doak Thanks, Mike and hi, Isaac. Isaac Ro Hi, Mark. Mark Doak On the ACG side, as Mike alluded to you in his earlier comments, obviously, it’s a key driver of our ongoing growth too. So specifically for this quarter on the enterprise side a trio of services that are largely around our asset management area and also include in the advanced bio area. So it’s hard to put an exact percentage on it, but obviously, we are putting a lot of effort behind growing what we see the differentiated side of our portfolio in consumables and services and putting R&D and marketing budgets behind that. I would also add based on the Patrick's comments, when you introduce new platform it is also a great opportunity to introduce new services and consumables around that and to that end we, obviously, have chance to augment introduction whether it’s consulting services or consumables that put a whole platform. So when you tie all together there is some nice synergies between what goes on from the LSAG side, the DGG side, and obviously, our ACG team. Isaac Ro And then maybe just bringing it home, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen All right. Thanks and thanks Isaac for asking the question, I am -- as you can hear, we can definitely talk long time about all the new exciting products. But I will just remind you that that we have a few different dynamics going on in my business. First of all, with the pathology and diagnostics businesses and we are in partnership.  This is not about bring out new product everyday, but they have -- you want to install your new instrument into the account and then get the contract and then run the rate and the new products we actually bring out there is new assay that goes on top of that. So you, of course, have a different lifecycle of the products that we have in chemical market compared to maybe in the genomics research market where we come up with some existing products also, the HaloPlex HS which actually address very low concentration of sequencing information, the [indiscernible] exome improvement also and Gene Expression arrays. Those have shorter lifetime and we see a higher percentage of our sales from this year and into next year from those products. Mike McMullen And why they made us put a bow on this discussion, but we talk a lot about the portfolio, but I would be remiss that to remind you of the channel change you made this year. So, we’re also -- we simplified our cell structure and it’s going to allow us to invest in buildout coverage. So I think you’re going to see our growth being fueled going forward not only on the strength of the new portfolio but also the expanded channel reach and specialization, we’ve been investing in. And this is a note through the first three quarters. I think our quarter revenues were over 6% and we’re on track for our strongest revenue growth in several years. I think probably a point greater than any other growth rates we’ve put up in the last three years. But again if I could just leave that with you on the combination of both the new product offerings but also our change in channel strategy as well. Isaac Ro All right. Hey guys, I really appreciate all the detail. I don’t want to sound too ungrateful but on that 6% number year-to-date, how much of it was on those new products? Mike McMullen We don't know. We don’t -- we don't have that number that we've shared externally but it’s been a contributor. All I can say is significant contributor. Isaac Ro Fair enough. Appreciate that. One last one, if I could just sneak in on China? Mike McMullen Yeah. Isaac Ro I think everyone is obviously trying to get a handle on what’s going on in the economy there. It seems to me maybe a simple way to break it up will be to delineate the percentage of your business in China that is maybe funded by sort of federal and in government sort of associated entities versus products that might be tied more to discretionary CapEx. Do you have a way to maybe break it down between those two buckets within, just sort of, I think, within China 17% of sales, maybe between those two end markets, how would you split it? Mike McMullen I don’t know if we have that, Didier. I know it’s been… Didier Hirsch No. Not at the company level, I mean, information, it’s probably tracked by some of our people. But I’m not collecting it and aggregating it. Mike McMullen What I can share with you is because we’ve been kind of nosing around on this question ourselves internally. And the areas of strength particularly the Pharma area is a lot of private sector money. So traditionally this market has been heavily dominated by the direct investment by the government. We’re seeing a move. I think it’s still the majority but we are seeing a lot more business coming from private funded enterprises, particularly as the Chinese government also is moving a lot of its testing outside of government testing labs, for example, the food area where there's now whole new set of private testing labs that are -- they are coming online in the country. Didier Hirsch Yeah. The other complexity we are even trying to attract that is for the companies that fewer Chinese companies that in their exporters versus the local -- I mean companies that can go after the local market, the exporters will benefit from the weakening yen. So it’s going to be that several layers of complexity, would we want to try to focus the overall impact of the weakening of the yen or the weakening of the Chinese GDP.  Isaac Ro Got it. Appreciate all the color guys. Thank you very much. Mike McMullen Thanks. Operator Thank your. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open. Dan Arias Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Mike McMullen Hey Dan. Dan Arias Mike just -- hi Mike. Just following up on the China discussion, what's your take at this point on where we are with the anti-corruption investigations? Is it your sense that we kind of fully turned the corner there or is it still little early to signal all clear on that? Mike McMullen Yeah, Dan. Great question. I think it's a new normal. I think this is -- the effort is here to stay. I think in terms of the changes where we talked about before of slowing deal velocity and a lot more conservatism in terms of the overall approval process. I think that sort of baked out now. So we’re no longer pointing to longer deal cycles in China as a result of anti-corruption. But I think the longer deal cycles are here to stay and now are now in this kind of this rhythm of really cautious approvals by the government authorities. And that's why I mentioned earlier that a lot of the areas of growth particularly in the private sector where you’ve not seen the same bureaucratic approach to approvals of deals. I think this is the new normal. Dan Arias Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on LSAG, can you maybe comment on pricing in chromatography as we just sort of thinking about the new product introductions and then just the strong overall results across the space. Curious maybe to just get an updated view on how ASPs are trending relative to ….? Mike McMullen Great. Dan. I’m going to bounce over to Patrick on this one. Patrick Kaltenbach Happy to take this one. So as you can imagine, every new product introduction gives the opportunity to also improve your gross margins and ASPs which we actually have seen. And there is actually for us, that’s one of the reasons why we’re also confident on delivering to the bottomline over the year. So we will continue to launch these new products because they are highly differentiated and give you an opportunity to drive ASP and we will keep ASP up which otherwise would erode overtime. Mike McMullen I think it is fair to say Patrick particular to -- specific to the Japan business, it’s not a new phenomenon. But our competitors there who don’t have the same currency challenges that we do are using that to be very aggressive at times on pricing but we have the gross margin structure to be able to compete. Dan Arias All right. Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken Good afternoon guys. So Mike, obviously as you sort of embarked to CEO of the new Agilent, you put forth a lot of programs to sustain sort of the superior growth and improve the margin and the cash flow generation. If you think about the various things highlighted in the call, where do you feel like you sort of outperformed kind of timing expectations and you’ve seen maybe similarly signs of the benefits in the organization and where do you feel like you need to make the most progress? Mike McMullen Thanks Ross. Appreciate the recognition of the kind comments. I think the area that I’m mostly done is the ability to get the margin improvements. I mean, we’re basically six months into the journey since I transitioned to the role from Bill. And I can see the momentum and our ability to get our margin structure to different place. I think you’ve heard reference in the number of times in our call today. And if you were inside the company, I think everybody knows the goal that we’re trying -- we're shooting for. So I think that’s the area that I’m really -- obviously the growth, pleased with their ability to grow. And we always want more growth but we’re looking for -- we're on pace to have our highest growth year since 2011. So -- and then I think there's been a solid reaction to how we modified our approach to couple of deployment as well.  Ross Muken Great. And again there seems to be just a little confusion sort of the order versus revenue pacing. Last quarter, obviously at the short fall, you build the backlog. It looked like $30 million you called out looked about right versus the last few years. In this quarter, it looked like you flushed around $60 million of backlog based on the differential versus orders. And then as we think about and again I realized most players in the industry don’t give a book to bill. It seems like your commentary is suggestive of your orders around track, which I guess would more imply we did see that backlog flush this quarter. And so I’m just trying to reconcile that versus Didier’s comment because I thought implied we didn’t get full all of the 30 back in some. I’m trying to reconcile the delta between what the backlog is showing and kind of what you actually saw in the business because in my mind you did about 1.01 book to bill over the two quarters. And again this is the CapEx business. So looking over a longer period is usually better. Mike McMullen Yeah. Thanks for that clarifying question, Ross. I think what Didier was trying to point out, I think we talked about $15 million of business coming in. We couldn’t ship it to the Q3. So obviously that came through this quarter. But the view is we’ve probably got another 15 in which we’ll ship and which we didn’t ship this quarter. Did that answer the question, Ross? Ross Muken Yeah. But I guess, on the order rate side, the other point, it seems like that's more of a function of timing and revenue recognition, any sort of underlying change in the tone of the business? Mike McMullen No. I understand your question now, so -- and again, I think we saw a good quarter momentum through the quarter. And you’ll see some new movements between quarters lot of times which we saw between Q2, Q3 and Q4. But the overall …. Ross Muken I guess, when you look at your business, I think year-to-date, you guys are probably the fastest-growing life science company at least that we look at in terms of traditional analytical equipment. As you try to figure out in -- it's tough comparing different companies, given different product and geographic exposure but where do you feel like you're doing the best and is it really maybe -- how much of it sort of leveraged to biopharma which seems to be healthiest end market, which you guys have obviously done well in versus may be technology share or other elements, some of the other sub-sectors. We’re just -- it is just of perception here that maybe you guys are growing on average to me, I’m curious if it is to you. Looks like you’re actually probably the fastest growing. So, I’m just trying to bridge that gap. Mike McMullen Our internal map would match your numbers or your view. Obviously, pharma, biopharma has been a key part of the growth story but it’s not the only part of the growth story. And I think it speaks to the breadth of our portfolio and businesses we are in so. As you know from -- you may recall from the analyst meeting, we talked at great length about our view of CrossLab services, consumable, informatics, how that was going to be an area of future growth outside of just the technology areas. And then you heard the DGG story already from Jacob and that’s a business that will continue to get momentum as we continue to put more and more of the [omnesys] [ph] out there. You start to close deals on the slides and then that starts to show up in revenue in the coming quarters. And then we haven’t talked about it today but Companion Diagnostics, we’ve been winning some deals there. So, I think it’s not only a story of end market strength in certain segments like pharma but also where we are playing in our view of lab-wide services and the momentum we have in our DDG business. And then finally, I think from a technology platform, it is very clear we are doing quite well in spectroscopy in the liquid phase and spectrometry areas.  Ross Muken Great. Thanks guys. Mike McMullen Thanks, Ross. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Miro Minkova with Stifel. Your line is open. Miro Minkova Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Mike McMullen Good afternoon. Miro Minkova Quick question here. Just about the revenue guidance reductions, heard just about that. Just trying to understand, Didier, if I heard you correctly, of the $37 million reduction in the sales line, $15 million is FX. What is the remainder of the reduction, where is it coming from? Didier Hirsch The $22 million remainder is basically a reassessment of our view on the chemical and energy markets where we are seeing now that the downstream refining and chemical markets are not picking up as fast as we expected the benefits of the low cheaper feedstock. So probably considering the fact that there is some little bit of stickiness about the world economy, we are not seeing the pickup in those downstream markets that will offset the drop in our revenues in the exploration production. So, we were hoping for again a pickup there and it’s not happening. And our business overall is about flat. Miro Minkova Okay. Got you. So no change in the remainder of the end markets? It’s all about chemicals. Got you. Didier Hirsch Yeah. That’s the one change, yeah. Miro Minkova Okay. Excellent. And separately, let me ask you, the $15 million of revenue, the help that you had from the revolution of your logistics center issues, was there any impact on margin on the operating margin expansion there? Mike McMullen Great question. So, Didier, correct me if I’ve got my math wrong here. But in terms of the topline, we got everything through. The shipments are back to normal. The customers experience is just fine. But we have seen cost overruns relative to our expectations as we work through the operational issues and I think it's probably been to the tune of about $0.01 on Q3 on reported EPS. Didier Hirsch But besides that from the $15 million, it’s about kind of average, vouching for that piece although there is probably a little bit more of consumable for the little bit better operating margin at the average. But still that in itself, we had the operating leverage not much else. And then, this point that Mike was making that as we worked addressing the issues that we were facing logistics centers, we incurred close to $0.01 of additional cost in Q3. Miro Minkova Got you. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan Hi. Thanks and good afternoon. Mike McMullen Good afternoon, Jack. Jack Meehan Yes. I just want to ask about some of commentary in the deck about the U.S. and state government deals getting pushed into 4Q. I was curios if you could give a little bit more commentary around that. And then just whether you thought any of the momentum in the academic and the market around and Congress around some improved funding, maybe that with impacting out there? Mike McMullen Patrick, you want to take that one. Patrick Kaltenbach I can take this one, yes. Thanks Mike. So what we have seen in the first half, you’ve heard all the comments, we actually had a pretty healthy business in this market segment. In Q3, we saw kind of a pause where we have seen several of our larger accounts, actually took a pause and reassessed the budget for the remainder of the year and just delayed several deals. So, we don’t see these deals lost and we really anticipate that we will see in academic, government section, especially in U.S. that picking up again in Q4 this year. Jack Meehan Got it. Understood. And then, just one question on the gross margins in the CrossLab business. Just curious if you had any thoughts around the pricing dynamic there just given that the consumable piece of the business was doing quite well, I thought we might see a little bit more pull through on the gross margin line?  Mike McMullen Mark, you want to take that question and then I might comment as well? Mark Doak Sure. And Jack, in terms of the year-to-year comparable, once again it’s apples to oranges on the CrossLab business. And next year, you will be in a great position to ask me because it will be an apples-to-apples compare between the two. But the vast majority of the synergies are the spin and we did invest money to obviously take care of some logistics issues. So as Mike talked about some of the impacted earnings per share, a lot of that came through on our business. So overall though, I don't think we've seen near but frankly, we haven’t seen that much pressure on the ASPs at this point in time. Mike, I don’t know if you want to add any comments? Mike McMullen Yeah. I think the ASPs, a really solid year and mainly and if you look at our prior year comparisons, it really been a story of the synergies and market picking up the load of the logistics center, cost overruns. And as you saw in our cost script, we are really investing heavily to bring out new chemistry products, which have some very nice margin structure associated with them. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll start with one, a bit of a retrospective for Mike. It has to do with sales force strategy. Mike, your several number months now into this area where you have consolidated sales forces. When you make a decision to consolidate the sales force, introduces a number of different possibilities. One is that you can be more nimble going after opportunities. Number two is of course, there can be disruptions. Can you reflect on that process, what you've seen and to the extent if you can, can you share any progress on metrics around that process? Mike McMullen Yeah. Great, great question. And in terms of the sales force changes as you pointed out, that was one of the first major changes we’ve made in the new Agilent. And I really think it's allowed us to streamline our executive structure and we had a lot of well meaning managers but we spend a lot of time discussing things internally. And this allow us to actually move a lot faster as we really entered two business, the analytical lab marketplace across a number of end markets and then in the regulated diagnostics space in Jacob's business. I'm very, very pleased with how the overall plan has gone. We have been very -- in terms of how we look at internally, we are ahead of our cost reduction goals. I think more importantly, we're getting the growth and we're getting the coverage. They want it to be able to invest to cover, make sure we can cover all the markets and invest in specialization where we needed. Now this is a multiyear program. So, I think this really I would say is the foundation year. And I think as you go into FY ‘16 and ’17, you start to get the full benefit of our ability to have really close account relationships backed up by very, very competent sales personnel. Steve Beuchaw Thanks Mike. And then one for Jacob. I’m not sure if you gave it earlier but if you didn’t, would you mind giving us a growth rate for the Dako business? And it would be really helpful if you could comment on where you think we are in terms of the process of Dako, what inning if you will sort of using American sports analogy? Are we in with Dako in terms of getting back to full scale and our ability to grow the business quickly? And then sorry to keep piling on here. But if you wouldn't mind, it sounds like just based on your tone and comments really that that business really is picking up. If you wouldn't give us a bit of insight into the nuts and bolts of where it is you're seeing the business pickup, is it equipment refreshes in the replacement cycle, is it more about competitor share gains, is it more about the instrumentation and the consumables that get run through the instruments? Any color there would be really helpful. Thanks again.  Jacob Thaysen All right, Steve. So, I will give you a little bit color without getting all the information about our underlying businesses here. But overall, the Dako businesses consist of few businesses. Two prime parts we have talked about is the pathology business and then our Companion Diagnostic business where the companion diagnostic is our partnering business with the pharma companies on developing new Companion Diagnostic within IHC and the FISH-based. And by the way, this is going very, very well and we will soon see the first significant launch of new Companion Diagnostic within a PLD-1 drug space. However, your questions around the pathology business and how we see that, I mean overall, we definitely see a good momentum. I will not say we are completely back in full scale yet. We did see some challenges last year on some back orders. We also have improved our performance on the Omnis over the last quarters, so we see actually all cylinders kick now. But it actually takes a few quarters to win deals in this space here. So, I would actually see continuous improvement over next few quarters. What we do see is that when we win deals, we of course win back. We win the deals that we -- in refresh of technology but we definitely also see a pickup in competitive deals as the Omnis solution is very competitive. And when you do that, when you put a new placement in, you will also get all the ranges running through that platform. So you place an instrument and then it takes another, maybe another quarter to get full loading of your consumables in there. So, I expect actually that we are in a good trajectory here. But the best remains to be seen also. Steve Beuchaw Great. Thanks again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is open. Dane Leone Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So can we just kind of clarify some of the commentary that’s been given so far on the organic growth expectations? Given from what you’ve said on the past, the previous questions, it seems like the weaker book-to-bill in the third quarter could have been, due to some of the weakness in the energy and chemical markets and that kind of flows through into the fourth quarter, or is it a function of something else? I guess when it comes down to, it doesn’t make -- it isn't completely apparent in terms of how the delayed orders would necessarily adversely affect the book-to-bill, but then there would be an ultimate catch-up to that? So, I guess, could you just kind of help us walk through, are the expectations purely oil and gas or is there something else in there that we need to think about for the fourth quarter specifically? Mike McMullen Sure. Dane, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify some of the earlier comments. I think the relative to what we reporting to in our U.S. government side of the business, that a situation where normally we face on last year’s deal activity, we had Q3 business last year and what we saw was, as Patrick mentioned, that business is going to go from Q3 to Q4. So that’s one of the reasons why you had a drop in the book-to-bill. I think as we mentioned earlier too, we started off slow in the third quarter coming off a very strong close to Q2. We start off flow in May. We saw the pace of orders we just didn’t chance to close all the business in the third quarter. I really wouldn’t point to the chemical and energy beyond the fact that its just a continuation of what we have been seeing, which is basically no growth, three quarters in a row and I’m not going to call a recovery like I done earlier this year. So we’re just remained cautious on the implied industrial market both, the chemical and energy, as well as mining sector of our business.  Dane Leone And then, if you -- one more question on China, I know you guys have answered a lot of them color. Mike McMullen Sure. Dane Leone Generally, at the end of these five-year plans there is somewhat of a spending flush. Is that -- it doesn't seem like many people contemplated that. Is that something guys have thought about or given the state of things over there? It would be too aggressive to hope for something to occur like that? Mike McMullen Yeah. I think great question again. We’ve taken a fairly conservative view on that, if it happens great, but we’re not counting on that, because there is lot of changes recently under the new leadership in terms of how they conduct their business. So, again, if it would happen, wonderful news for the industry, but we're not counting on them in our go-forward forecast. Dane Leone Okay. Great. And one last one for me on the gross margin line, the current guidance does seem like we get above that 54% in the fourth quarter? Is that something that you guys feel confident, we’ll see given where the FX rates and the composition of the product mix that we would expect there or should we kind of alter expectations where the operating margin uptick comes from? Mike McMullen Yeah. I think I bounce that over to Didier if you want to. Didier Hirsch Yeah. We don’t usually provide guidance on the gross margin level. But yes, we're expecting a slight improvement in gross margin sequentially between Q3 and Q4. Mike McMullen That’s typically where we that kind of pattern we see historically as particularly in the services side as we finish out the year. Dane Leone Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike McMullen Hi Derik. Derik de Bruin Hi. Good afternoon. Sorry about that. I was on mute. Couple of question. So is your fourth quarter guidance dependent upon any large changed orders in the government? Mike McMullen I’m looking at Patrick right now and he is shaking his head, no. Derik de Bruin Great. So I think there is some concern the commodity prices need to fall, there is some concern the commodity prices may continue to fall. So if you do have -- if we given it like 5% to 10% decline in current level commodity price, how does that impact [Technical Difficulty] Mike McMullen I think we’ve been carrying this free fall of commodity prices for some time. So our view is that if we continue to see downward pressure, I think it would push out your return to growth in this segment but the business is pretty subdued there already. Patrick, I don’t know if you have anything, you’d add to that. Patrick Kaltenbach Yeah. I mean what we discussed beginning of this year was that we actually could see some upside, which flow of feedstock prices, which didn’t kick in so far but which would be a fundamental underlying economical drive if the feedstock price could go further down. So I would say we are on the exploration side. We’re definitely not further exposed than we are already today. Didier Hirsch Yeah. On one hand we’re losing, on the other hand we saw economies with larger importers of commodities whether its oil or others, it’s a big plus, China, India, Japan so. Derik de Bruin Great. And just one final question, can you sort of remind us on your manufacturing footprint what you do in China versus Malaysia? And I guess the question -- on the basis of that question, I think there is some concerns that there could be some currency devaluation on some of the other countries and I think people were -- I'm getting some questions from investors about company exposure. Mike McMullen Yeah. Great question. So if you look at what we call strategic manufacturing side, so we’re fairly diversified globally but we have two major sites in Asia. One is in China for our gas chromatography, which is a major product line for us. And then in Penang, Malaysia, we have all of our spectroscopy atomic and molecular spectroscopy, as well as some of our vacuum products and some of the DGG products. So they are two major sites for us.  Derik De Bruin Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Ramsey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Catherine Ramsey Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Mike McMullen Sure. Catherine Ramsey Can we get a big picture update on Europe, just kind of what you’re seeing in that market? Mike McMullen I’m sorry. You broke up, was that Europe? Catherine Ramsey Yes. Mike McMullen Okay. I think our European outside of the currency offset, I mean the business there has been a really nice story for us this year and I point to Patrick. But I think we're seeing no real significant changes there. The one part of the European business that we’re keeping a close eye on is really some of the emerging economies in Africa and the Middle East, how that could play out, but Western Europe has been pretty good for us. Patrick Kaltenbach It has been very good. In terms of end markets, pharma has been definitely very strong story. We have seen flat to healthy business in the range of life science research overall. There is actually some upside potential there with we noticed to spending of the [EZB] [ph] that should also materialize in research over time. So for us the European market although has held up very nicely and we have been positively surprised over several quarters now by the local currency growth we have seen in Europe. Mike McMullen And it hasn’t been just a story on the instrumentation side, we’ve really -- the customers really have responded to this CrossLab promise that the Mark’s team has put together. There is a lot of big wins on the service side in particular and then you heard already what’s been going on in the Dako and DDG business. Catherine Ramsey All right. Thank you. And one more question from me. I guess probably for Mike, how do you feel about the overall visibility in the business? You may be ignoring backlog metrics specifically and how has that changed over the past 6 to 12 months? Mike McMullen I think your question was how do I think about overall visibility in the business? So that’s the question. Catherine Ramsey Yes. Mike McMullen All right. Great. You broke up a bit. I think what we've seen is the visibility is pretty good out a quarter or so and this is a reminder. We book orders. We don’t book any orders unless they can be delivered in six months. So I think our visibility of a three to six kind of months' timeframe is pretty solid because we got the funnel. And course we have deal funnels that we track that have longer deal cycles. So we have a pretty confident view three to six months out and a kind of a longer-term view beyond that through our sales funnel metrics. I would say though that and this is the point that Didier made earlier that we are seeing more and more of the business come late in the quarter. And rather than hoping for a change in historical and to this pattern, we now made this our new normal in terms of how we think and plan for business on the revenue side. Catherine Ramsey Great. Thank you. It’s very helpful. Operator Thank you. I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez Thank you, Abigail. And thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us call on IR. And on behalf of all the management team, I’d like to wish you a good day. Thanks. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.
